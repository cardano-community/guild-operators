Running your own Cardano node has never been so fast and easy.

> But first, a kindly reminder to the security aspects of running containers. [Here some Docker security concepts and best practice](docker/docker_security.md).

### External resources

- [DockerHub Guild's images](https://hub.docker.com/u/cardanocommunity)
- [YouTube Guild's Videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1eg3ljUWjIHeU0Vpqicj6A)

### ðŸ”” Built-in tools

- CNTools
- gLiveView
- CNCLI
- Monitoring ready
  - EKG, Prometheus

#### Guild Operators Docker startegy (testnet / mainnet / staging / guild)  {docsify-ignore}

Modular docker images based on Debian.

Based on the Guild's work we decided to build the Cardano Node images in 3 stages:

- 1st stage: it uses `prereq.sh` to prepare the development enviroment before compiling the node source code.  -> [Stage1](../files/docker/dockerfile_stage1)
- 2nd stage: based on stage1, this stage intent is to compile and produce the binaries of the node. -> [Stage2](../files/docker/dockerfile_stage2)
- 3rd stage: based upon a minimal debian image it incorporates the node's binaries as well as all the Guild's tools. -> [Stage3](../files/docker/dockerfile_stage3)

### Additional docs  {docsify-ignore}

If you prefer to build the images your own than you can check:

- [Podman Tips](docker/podman.md)

### Port mapping

> The dockerfiles are located in ./files/docker/

> Node Ports        |  Wallet Ports      | Flavors
>------------:      | -------------:     | :-------------:
>Node  (6000)       | Wallet (8090)      | Debian (`Dockerfile`)
>Prometheus (12798) | Prometheus (12798) |
>EKG (12781)        |                    |
