Running your own Cardano node has never been so fast and easy.

#### Guild Operators Docker strategy ( mainnet/ testnet / preview / preprod / guild)  {: id="strategy"}

Modular docker images based on Debian.

Based on the Guild's work we decided to build the Cardano Node images in 3 stages:

- 1st stage: it uses `prereq.sh` to prepare the development enviroment before compiling the node source code.  -> [Stage1](https://github.com/cardano-community/guild-operators/blob/master/files/docker/node/dockerfile_stage1)
- 2nd stage: based on stage1, this stage intent is to compile and produce the binaries of the node. -> [Stage2](https://github.com/cardano-community/guild-operators/blob/master/files/docker/node/dockerfile_stage2)
- 3rd stage: based upon a minimal debian image it incorporates the node's binaries as well as all the Guild's tools. -> [Stage3](https://github.com/cardano-community/guild-operators/blob/master/files/docker/node/dockerfile_stage3)

### Additional docs

If you prefer to build the images your own than you can check:

### Port mapping

 The dockerfiles are located in ./files/docker/
