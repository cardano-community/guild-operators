This documentation site (rather the repository itself) is created by some of the well known and experienced community members and contains instructions/information about various guild tools which simplify various stake-ops (setting up, managing and monitoring pools) for operators. Note that the guides are present to help you simplify your tasks - but as an entity responsible for creating blocks on a financial platform, we expect the pre-requisite skill sets - at professional level - before entering the portal:

  - Learn about working with architecture, setup and essentials (SysOps);
  - Understand how to secure your server (SecOps);
  - Be comfortable with working with `cardano-cli`, and have worked on testnet for pool operations without use of wrapper scripts - as an education exercise;
  - Read the documentation and disclaimers. The guide and tools only aim to simplify your tasks, it will not try to do everything for you - neither scope best practices.
  - We recommend anyone using these instructions to use offline workflow, and **NEVER** have their wallet keys and pool keys to be made available to online servers, as supported by the tools.

Everyone is welcome to contribute to the repository (via documentation, testing, code, videos, etc). Our aim is to work together and reduce confusion rather than hosting 100 versions of documentation - each marketing their pool in a way.
