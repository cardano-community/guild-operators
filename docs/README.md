This documentation (rather the repository itself) is created by some of the community members and serves as an easy means to add documentation or scripts that make more sense to users. The target audience for this document are mainly experienced stake pool operators.

Everyone is welcome to contribute to the repository (via documentation, testing, code, videos, etc). Our aim is to work together and reduce confusion rather than hosting 100 versions of documentation - each marketing their pool in a way.

If there are any discrepancies/suggestions/contributions for this document, please open an Issue or PR and we should be able to add the changes in.

#### Getting Started {docsify-ignore}

Use the sidebar to navigate through the topics. Note that the instructions assume the folder structure as per [here](basics.md#folder-structure).

!> Note that the cardano codebase is still being cooked in the oven while we're trying to taste it, expect hand burns if not careful.
Since we're just trying to keep up with codebase, expect rapid changes.

> Again, Feedback/Contribution and ownership of tasks is always welcome. If you're interested in collaborating regularly, make a start - and you should be part of guild already :smile:.
