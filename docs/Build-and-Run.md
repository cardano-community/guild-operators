### Build and Run

This document is built using instructions from [IOH repositories](https://github.com/input-output-hk) as base with additional info/clarification, which we can propose to add if it makes sense.

The instructions are intentionally limited to cabal to avoid wait times/availability of nix/docker/stack.yaml files being up to date - and managing multiple versions of instructions (for now).

Note that the instructions are mainly focused around building Cardano components and OS/thirdparty software (eg: postgres) setup instructions are intended to provide build level information only.

Ofcourse, we can always add links with specific best practices to those instructions - for those who would like to contribute, please open a PR directly on the [github repo](https://github.com/cardano-community/guild-operators/tree/master/docs) to do so.
