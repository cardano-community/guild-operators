#### Dependencies and Folder Structure setup

The pre-requisites for Linux systems are automated to be executed as a single script. Follow the instructions below to deploy the same:

``` bash
mkdir "$HOME/tmp";cd "$HOME/tmp"
# Install wget
# CentOS / RedHat - sudo dnf -y install wget
# Ubuntu / Debian - sudo apt -y install wget
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cardano-community/guild-operators/master/files/ptn0/scripts/prereqs.sh
chmod 755 prereqs.sh
# Ensure you can run sudo commands with your user before execution
./prereqs.sh
. "${HOME}/.bashrc"
## Follow the prompts for execution
```

#### Folder structure

Running the script above will create the folder structure as per below, for your reference.
