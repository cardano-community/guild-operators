#### Architecture

The architecture for various components are already described at [docs.cardano.org](https://docs.cardano.org/explore-cardano/cardano-architecture/overview) by CF/IOHK. We will not reinvent the wheel :smile:

#### Manual Software Pre-Requirements


While we do not intend to hand out step-by-step instructions, the tools are often misused as a shortcut to avoid ensuring base skillsets mentioned on home page. Some of the common gotchas that we often find SPOs to miss out on:

    - It is imperative that pools operate with highly accurate system time, in order to propogate blocks to network in a timely manner and avoid penalties to own (or at times other competing) blocks. Please refer to sample guidance [here ](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/network-ntp) for details - the precise steps may depend on your OS.
    - Ensure your Firewall rules at Network as well as OS level are updated according to the usage of your system, you'd want to whitelist the rules that you really need to open to world (eg: You might need node, SSH, and potentially secured webserver/proxy ports to be open, depending on components you run).
    - Update your SSH Configuration to prevent password-based logon.
    - Ensure that you use offline workflow, you should never require to have your offline keys on online nodes. The tools provide you backup/restore functionality to only pass online keys to online nodes.

#### Pre-Requisites

!!! info "Reminder !!"
     You're expected to run the commands below from same session, using same working directories as indicated and using a `non-root user with sudo access`. You are expected to be familiar with this as part of pre-requisite skill sets for stake pool operators.

##### Set up OS packages, folder structure and fetch files from repo {: #os-prereqs}

The pre-requisites for Linux systems are automated to be executed as a single script. To download the pre-requisites scripts, execute the below:

```bash
mkdir "$HOME/tmp";cd "$HOME/tmp"
# Install curl
# CentOS / RedHat - sudo dnf -y install curl
# Ubuntu / Debian - sudo apt -y install curl
curl -sS -o prereqs.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cardano-community/guild-operators/master/scripts/cnode-helper-scripts/prereqs.sh
chmod 755 prereqs.sh
```

Please familiarise with the syntax of `prereqs.sh` before proceeding. The usage syntax can be checked using `./prereqs.sh -h` , sample output below:

``` bash
Usage: prereqs.sh [-f] [-s] [-i] [-l] [-c] [-w] [-o] [-b <branch>] [-n <mainnet|testnet|guild|staging>] [-t <name>] [-m <seconds>]
Install pre-requisites for building cardano-node and using CNTools

-f    Force overwrite of all files including normally saved user config sections in env, cnode.sh and gLiveView.sh
      topology.json, config.json and genesis files normally saved will also be overwritten
-s    Skip installing OS level dependencies (Default: will check and install any missing OS level prerequisites)
-n    Connect to specified network (mainnet | guild | testnet | staging) (Default: mainnet)
      eg: -n testnet
-t    Alternate name for top level folder, non alpha-numeric chars will be replaced with underscore (Default: cnode)
-m    Maximum time in seconds that you allow the file download operation to take before aborting (Default: 60s)
-l    Use system libsodium instead of IOG fork (Default: use libsodium from IOG fork)
-c    Install/Upgrade and build CNCLI with RUST
-w    Install/Upgrade Vacuumlabs cardano-hw-cli for hardware wallet support
-o    Install/Upgrade Ogmios Server binary
-b    Use alternate branch of scripts to download - only recommended for testing/development (Default: master)
-i    Interactive mode (Default: silent mode)
```

Running without any parameters will run script in silent mode with OS Dependencies, install libsodium fork from IOG, and *NOT* force overwrite of all files (only static files will be overwritten, which should not contain user modifications):

``` bash
./prereqs.sh
. "${HOME}/.bashrc"
```

##### Folder structure

Running the script above will create the folder structure as per below, for your reference. You can replace the top level folder `/opt/cardano/cnode` by editing the value of `CNODE_HOME` in `~/.bashrc` and `$CNODE_HOME/files/env` files:


    /opt/cardano/cnode            # Top-Level Folder
    ├── ...
    ├── files                     # Config, genesis and topology files
    │   ├── ...
    │   ├── byron-genesis.json    # Byron Genesis file referenced in config.json
    │   ├── shelley-genesis.json  # Genesis file referenced in config.json
    │   ├── alonzo-genesis.json    # Alonzo Genesis file referenced in config.json
    │   ├── config.json           # Config file used by cardano-node
    │   └── topology.json         # Map of chain for cardano-node to boot from
    ├── db                        # DB Store for cardano-node
    ├── guild-db                  # DB Store for guild-specific tools and additions (eg: cncli, cardano-db-sync's schema)
    ├── logs                      # Logs for cardano-node
    ├── priv                      # Folder to store your keys (permission: 600)
    ├── scripts                   # Scripts to start and interact with cardano-node
    └── sockets                   # Socket files created by cardano-node
