# 6th Meeting

Thank you all for joining and working on the project :smile:

I will try to provide a short summary of the 6th guild pgREST meeting (held on `29/07/2021 - 07:00 UTC`), both for logging purposes and for those who were not able to attend.

### Participants:

- Homer
- Ola
- Markus
- Priyank
- Damjan
- RedOracle
- RC

### PROBLEMS

- Not everyone reporting to the monitoring dashboard
- We don't fully understand the execution time deviations of the stake distribution query
- catalyst rewards are hard to isolate
- branch 10.1.x has been deleted on the db-sync repo
- people have a hard time catching up with the project after being away for a while

### ACTIONS

- missing instances start reporting to monitoring
- run stake_distribution query on multiple instances, report output of `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)`
- catalyst rewards can be ignored until there is a clear path to get them: Fix underway using open PR
- if someone needs help getting the right db-sync commit, message Priyank for help as the branch is now deleted
- add project metadata (requirements) to pgrest doc header in a checklist format that folks can use to ensure their setup is up-to-date with the current project state

- Discussed long-term plans (will be added separately in group)
