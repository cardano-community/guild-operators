# 5th Meeting

Thank you all for joining and working on the project :smile:

I will try to provide a short summary of the 5th guild pgREST meeting (held at `22/07/2021 - 07:00 UTC`), both for logging purposes and for those who were not able to attend.

### Participants:

- Homer
- Ola
- Markus
- Priyank
- Damjan
- RedOracle

PROBLEMS

- how to sync live stake between instances (or is there need for it?)

ACTIONS

1. Team

- catch live stake distributions in a separate table (in our `grest` schema)
  - these queries can run on a schedule
  - response comes from the instance with the latest data
  - other approaches:
    - possibly distribute pools between instances (complex approach)
    - run full query once and only check for new/leaving delegators (probably impossible because of existing delegator UTXO movements)
- implement monitoring of execution times for all the queries
- come up with a timeline for launch (next call)
- stress test before launch
- start building queries listed on Trello board

2. Individual

- sync db-sync instances to commit `84226d33eed66be8e61d50b7e1dacebdc095cee9` on `release/10.1.x`
- update setups to reflect recent directory restructuring and updated instructions: https://rdlrt.ga/guild2/Build/pgrest/
