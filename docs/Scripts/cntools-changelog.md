All notable changes to this tool will be documented in this file.

!> Whenever you're updating between versions where format/hash of keys have changed , or you're changing networks - it is recommended to Backup your Wallet and Pool folders before you proceed with launching cntools on a fresh network.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [5.3.5] - 2020-08-20

##### Changed
- CNTools now uses and works with `cardano-node 1.19.0`, please upgrade if you're not using this version.

##### Fixed
- A new getPoolID helper function added to extract both hex and bech32 pool ID
  - Added `--output-format hex` when extracting pool ID in hex format
  - A new pool.id-bech32 file gets created if cold.vkey is available and decrypted
- Added error check to see if cardano-cli is in $PATH before continuing.

## [5.3.4] - 2020-08-18

##### Changed

## [5.3.3] - 2020-08-14

##### Added
- Use secure remove (`srm`) when available when deleting files.

## [5.3.2] - 2020-08-05

> If you're coming version 5.2.1 (not required if you're on 5.3.0), We have made quite a few changes to not use ptn0 in our scripts and source github structures (except template files), alongwith other changes listed beneath. Please follow steps below for upgrade:  
> - Execute the below (by default it will set you up against mainnet network), do not overwrite config please:  
>    `cd "$CNODE_HOME"/scripts`  
>    `curl -sS -o prereqs.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cardano-community/guild-operators/master/scripts/cnode-helper-scripts/prereqs.sh`  
>    `chmod 755 prereqs.sh`  
>    `./prereqs.sh -s`  
> - Start using updated cnode.sh to run a passive node, or edit the cnode.sh to include your pool keys and run as pool owner.

=======

#### Fixed
- Backup & Restore paths were failing on machines due to alnum class availability on certain interpreters.
- Rewards were not counted in stake and pledge

## [5.3.1] - 2020-08-04
##### Added
- Balance check notification added before wallet selection menus are shown to know that work is done in the background 

##### Changed
- Removed ledger dump dependency from Pool Register, Modify, Retire and List.
  - The cost of the ledger dump is too high, replaced with a simple check if pools registration certificate exist in pool folder
  - Pool >> Show|Delegators are now the only options dumping the ledger-state

##### Fixed
- Removed +i file locking on .addr files when using `Wallet >> Encrypt` as these are re-generated from keys and need to be writable
- Balance check added to `Funds >> Withdraw` for base address as this is used to pay the withdraw transaction fee
- Resolve issue with Multi Owner causing an error with new pool registration (error was due to quotes)

## [5.3.0] - 2020-08-03
##### Added
- Ability to select a different pool owner and reward wallet

- itnRewards.sh script to claim ITN rewards incl docs update
- More explicit error messages at startup

##### Changed
- POOL_PLEDGECERT_FILENAME removed from config, WALLET_DELEGCERT_FILENAME is used instead for delegation cert to pool, no need to keep a separate cert in pool folder for this, its the wallet that is delegated.
- Wallet vkeys no longer encrypted as skeys are the only ones in need of protection
- Update command change (change applied after this release is active):
  - Minor/Patch release: it will warn, backup and replace CNTools script files including cntools.config
  - Major release: No change, prompt user to backup and run prereqs.sh according to instructions.
- Troubleshooting improvements:
  - Split 'config in json format' and 'hasPrometheus' checks
  - Output node sync stats if Shelley transition epoch is to be calculated
  - Protocol parameters output check to give an improved error message
- Pool >> Show view updated to show modified pool values if Pool >> Modify has been used to update pool parameters
  - The section has also been updated to make it a little bit easier to read
- Pool >> Delegators view also use updated pledge value if a pool modification has been registered to check if pledge is met
- Use mainnet as default, since other testnets are either retired or not being maintained :(
- Backup original files when doing upgrades, so that users do not lose their changes.

##### Fixed
- Mainnet uses dedicated condition for slot checks
- Timeout moved to a variable in cntools.library
- KES Calculation for current KES period and KES expiration date
  **Please re-check expiration date using Pool >> Show**

  - Please make sure to use **config files created by the prereqs.sh, or enable JSON loggers for your config**.
- Update cnode.sh.templ to archive logs every time node is restart, this ensures that we're not searching for previous log history when network was changed. Network being changed would automatically deduce db folder was deleted.
