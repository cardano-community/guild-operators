## [6.0.0] - 2020-10-15

> This is a major release with a lot of changes. It is highly recommended that you familiarise yourself with the usage for Hybrid or Online v/s Offline mode on a testnet environment before doing it on production. Please visit https://cardano-community.github.io/guild-operators/#/upgrade for details.

##### Added
- Allow CNTools to operate in offline mode. Offline features include:
  - Simplified Walet Show/List menu
  - Wallet delete without balance check option
  - Pool KES Rotation
  - Sign a staging transaction.
- Allow creation of staging tx files using ttl as input in an online/offline-hybrid mode, that can be sent to offline server to sign.
  - To Transfer Funds
  - Withdraw Rewards
  - Delegate
  - Register/Modify/Retire pool
- Allow import of a signed transaction to submit in online mode
- Allow import of 15/24 words based wallets. Note that you'd need `cardano-address` and `bech32` in yout $PATH to use this feature (available if you rebuild `cardano-node` using updated `cabal-build-all.sh`), reusing [guide from @ilap](https://gist.github.com/ilap/3fd57e39520c90f084d25b0ef2b96894).

##### Fixed
- Check `pool >> show` stake distribution showing up as always 0.
- KES expiration calculation
- Slot interval calculation
- Custom vname replacement(when using `prereqs.sh -t`) fix for internal update
- Pool registration and de-registration certificates removed in case of retire/re-registration


## [5.4.1] - 2020-09-10

- KES Expiry to use KES Period instead of Epoch duration


## [5.4.0] - 2020-08-23

> A non-breaking change have been made to files outside of CNTools. Internal update function is not enough to update all files.  
> - Execute the below (by default it will set you up against mainnet network), do not overwrite config please:  
>    `cd "$CNODE_HOME"/scripts`  
>    `curl -sS -o prereqs.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cardano-community/guild-operators/master/scripts/cnode-helper-scripts/prereqs.sh`  
>    `chmod 755 prereqs.sh`  
>    `./prereqs.sh -s`  
> - Start using updated cnode.sh to run a passive node, or edit the cnode.sh to include your pool keys and run as pool owner.

=======

##### Added
- Sanity check before launching a second instance of cnode.sh
- Doc update to run cnode.sh as a systemd service

##### Removed
- `Pool >> Delegators` removed.
  - If/when a better option than dumping and parsing ledger-state dump arise re-adding it will be considered.

##### Fixed
- Block Collector script adapted for cardano-node 1.19.0.
  - Block hash is now truncated in log, issue https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/issues/1738
- High cpu usage reported in a few cases when running Block Collector
  - Depending on log level, parsing and byte64 enc each entry with jq could potentially put high load on weaker systems. Replaced with grep to only parse entries containing specific traces.
- Docs for creating systemd block collector service file updated to include user env in run command


## [5.3.6] - 2020-08-22

##### Fixed
- cardano-node 1.19.0 introduced an issue that required us to use KES as current - 1 while rotating.


## [5.3.5] - 2020-08-20

##### Changed
- CNTools now uses and works with `cardano-node 1.19.0`, please upgrade if you're not using this version.

##### Added
- Balance check notification added before wallet selection menus are shown to know that work is done in the background

- Removed ledger dump dependency from Pool Register, Modify, Retire and List.
  - The cost of the ledger dump is too high, replaced with a simple check if pools registration certificate exist in pool folder
  - Pool >> Show|Delegators are now the only options dumping the ledger-state

##### Fixed
- Removed +i file locking on .addr files when using `Wallet >> Encrypt` as these are re-generated from keys and need to be writable
- Balance check added to `Funds >> Withdraw` for base address as this is used to pay the withdraw transaction fee
- Resolve issue with Multi Owner causing an error with new pool registration (error was due to quotes)


## [5.3.0] - 2020-08-03
##### Added
- Ability to select a different pool owner and reward wallet

- Pool >> Show view updated to show modified pool values if Pool >> Modify has been used to update pool parameters
  - The section has also been updated to make it a little bit easier to read

- Use mainnet as default, since other testnets are either retired or not being maintained :(
- Backup original files when doing upgrades, so that users do not lose their changes.

##### Fixed
- Mainnet uses dedicated condition for slot checks
- Timeout moved to a variable in cntools.library
- KES Calculation for current KES period and KES expiration date
  **Please re-check expiration date using Pool >> Show**
