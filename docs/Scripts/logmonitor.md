`logMonitor.sh` is a general purpose json log monitoring script for traces created by cardano-node. Currently it will look for traces related to leader slots and block creation but other uses could be added in the future. 

##### Block traces
For the core node (block producer) the `logMonitor.sh` script can be run to monitor the json log file created by cardano-node for traces related to leader slots and block creation.   

For optimal coverage, it's best run together with [CNCLI](Scripts/cncli.md) scripts as they provide different functionality. Together they create a complete picture of blocks assigned, created, validated or invalid due to node issue. 

##### Installation
The script is best run as a background process. This can be accomplished in many ways but the preferred method is to run it as a systemd service. A terminal multiplexer like tmux or screen could also be used but not covered here.

Use the `deploy-as-systemd.sh` script to create a systemd unit file (deployed together with [CNCLI](Scripts/cncli.md)).
Log output is handled by syslog and end up in the systems standard syslog file, normally `/var/log/syslog`. `journalctl -f -u cnode-logmonitor.service` can be used to check service output(follow mode). Other logging configurations are not covered here.

Best viewed in CNTools or gLiveView. See [CNCLI](Scripts/cncli.md) for example output.
