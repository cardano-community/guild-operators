Tha stake holders in simple words are those who are participating in stakings, namely:
  - [Operators](Staking/Operators.md), who operate staking pools,
  - [Owners](Staking/Owners.md), who own a pool, in some extent, by pledging their stakes to pools and the
  - [Delegates](Staking/Delegates.md), who delegate their staking rights to stake pools.

For participating in staking, every stake holder must have some form of different type of `address keys`:
  - payment keys, which can or cannot participate in staking and 
  - staking keys for receiving staking (stake or pool)  rewards.
