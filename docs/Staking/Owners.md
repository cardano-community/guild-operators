The owners are the stake holders who have some funds deposited and want to own, in some extent, a staking pool. The owner's objectives are the following:
  - Create `payment key(s)` for generating `base` payment addresses.
  - Create `stake key(s)` for generating  __pool__ `reward address`.
  - Create and submit the owner's `delegation certificate` for pledging.

> Note: In this example the operator's stake and payment keys will be used for pledging.
That means the the __operator__ is the __owner__.
