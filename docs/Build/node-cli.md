> Ensure the [Pre-Requisites](basics.md#pre-requisites) are in place before you proceed.

#### Build Instructions {docsify-ignore}

##### Clone the repository

Execute the below to clone the cardano-node repository to $HOME/git folder on your system:

``` bash
cd ~/git
git clone https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node
cd cardano-node
```

##### Build Cardano Node

You can use the instructions below to build the cardano-node, same steps can be executed in future to update the binaries (replacing appropriate tag) as well.

``` bash
git fetch --tags --all
# Replace release 1.19.0 with the version/branch/tag you'd like to build
git pull
git checkout 1.19.0

echo -e "package cardano-crypto-praos\n  flags: -external-libsodium-vrf" > cabal.project.local
# On CentOS 7 (GCC 4.8.5) we should also do
# echo -e "package cryptonite\n  flags: -use_target_attributes" >> cabal.project.local

$CNODE_HOME/scripts/cabal-build-all.sh
```

The above would copy the binaries built into `~/.cabal/bin` folder.

##### Verify

Execute cardano-cli and cardano-node to verify output as below:

```bash
cardano-cli version
# cardano-cli 1.19.0 - linux-x86_64 - ghc-8.6
# git rev 4814003f14340d5a1fc02f3ac15437387a7ada9f
cardano-node version
# cardano-node 1.19.0 - linux-x86_64 - ghc-8.6
# git rev 4814003f14340d5a1fc02f3ac15437387a7ada9f
```

##### Start a passive node

To test starting the node in interactive mode, you can use the pre-built script below (note that the config now uses `SimpleView` so you may not see much output):

```bash
cd $CNODE_HOME/scripts
./cnode.sh
```

##### Run as systemd service

The preferred way to run the node is through a service manager like systemd. This section explains how to setup a systemd service file.

**1. Create systemd service file** 
Replace `$USER` with the correct user for your system. Copy & paste all code below to create the service file.
``` bash
sudo bash -c "cat << 'EOF' > /etc/systemd/system/cnode.service
[Unit]
Description=Cardano Node
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5
User=$USER
LimitNOFILE=1048576
WorkingDirectory=$CNODE_HOME/scripts
ExecStart=/bin/bash -l -c \"exec $CNODE_HOME/scripts/cnode.sh\"
ExecStop=/bin/bash -l -c \"exec kill -2 \$(ps -ef | grep [c]ardano-node.*.node0.socket | tr -s ' ' | cut -d ' ' -f2)\"
KillSignal=SIGINT
SuccessExitStatus=143
StandardOutput=syslog
StandardError=syslog
SyslogIdentifier=cnode
TimeoutStopSec=5
KillMode=mixed

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF"
```

**2. Reload systemd and enable automatic start of service on startup**  
``` bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable cnode.service
```

**3. Start the node**  
Run below commands to enable automatic start of service on startup and start it.
``` bash
sudo systemctl start cnode.service
```

**4. Check status and stop/start commands** 
Replace `status` with `stop`/`start`/`restart` depending on what action to take.
``` bash
sudo systemctl status cnode.service
```

You can use [sLiveView](Scripts/sliveview.md) to monitor your pool that was started as systemd, if you miss the LiveView functionality.

##### Steps to transition from LiveView in tmux to systemd setup

If you've followed guide from this repo previously and would like to transfer to systemd usage, please checkout the steps below:

1. Stop previous instance of node if already running (eg: in tmux)
2. Run `prereqs.sh` OR simply replace `LiveView` to `SimpleView` in your $CNODE_HOME/files/config.json.
   (PS: Remember to preserve your customisations to cnode.sh, topology.json, env files - you can refer to changes in [PR-449](https://github.com/cardano-community/guild-operators/pull/449/files) to manually apply changes without affecting your setup much)
3. Follow the instructions [above](#run-as-systemd-service) to setup your node as a service and start it using systemctl as directed.
4. If you need to monitor via interactive terminal as before, use [sLiveView](Scripts/sliveview.md).
