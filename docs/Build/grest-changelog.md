### Changes for API

#### Data Output Changes

- Fix: Remove redundant policy_info for `/asset_txs`, returning transactions as an array - allows for leveraging native PostgREST filtering. [#1409](https://github.com/cardano-community/guild-operators/pull/1403)

### Changes for Instance Providers

#### Added
- Add setup-grest.sh versioning.

[#1403](https://github.com/cardano-community/guild-operators/pull/1403)

#### Fixed
- Delete token token-registry folder when running `setup-grest.sh` with `-r` (reset flag), as the delta registry records to insert depends on file (POSIX) timestamps. [#1410](https://github.com/cardano-community/guild-operators/pull/1410)
