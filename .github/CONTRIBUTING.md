## Code Style Guidelines

This project uses EditorConfig to maintain consistent coding styles across different developers, editors, and IDEs.

The `.editorconfig` file in this repository defines the style rules. To get the most out of EditorConfig, make sure your editor is configured to use it. This will automatically apply the project's style rules when you edit/save files.
