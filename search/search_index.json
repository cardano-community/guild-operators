Note that the guides are present to help you simplify your tasks - but as an entity responsible for creating blocks on a financial platform, we expect the pre-requisite skill sets - at professional level - before entering the portal: Learn about working with architecture, setup and essentials (SysOps); Understand how to secure your server (SecOps); Be comfortable with working with cardano-cli , and have worked on testnet for pool operations without use of wrapper scripts - as an education exercise; Read the documentation and disclaimers. The guide and tools only aim to simplify your tasks, it will not try to do everything for you - neither scope best practices. We recommend anyone using these instructions to use offline workflow, and NEVER have their wallet keys and pool keys to be made available to online servers, as supported by the tools. Everyone is welcome to contribute to the repository (via documentation, testing, code, videos, etc). Our aim is to work together and reduce confusion rather than hosting 100 versions of documentation - each marketing their pool in a way.

Queries \u2693\ufe0e Transaction cache table: We would like to avoid 'handling' rollbacks in that table, instead simply dump if multiple entries for a transaction, as it can have much higher combination and volume to process - especially post a node/postgres/dbsync restart. Solution being tested: Use an md5 hash of concatenated tx_id, tx_index and block hash to generate unique serves as primary key in that table On RPC built off cache tables query layer, we would add a validation for block hash being in the public.block table and exclude those who are not as part of result This way we don't handle rollbacks, and also keep a record if in future we require to cross check/re-run delta Pool cache table: Need to check if transaction cache method is useful here too Using strace we could verify the order in which tables are touched, and avoid trigger-check to run on every block. Problems \u2693\ufe0e Priyank noticed that if including any foreign keys for tx cache, it can cause a spike in load resulting in crash of db-sync instance (with locks). There arent any visible advantages maintaining a constraint on cache table anyways, as it decreases performance. Thus, we'd keep the cache tables simple and not include any foreign keys. Infrastructure upgrades unlikely to help for such cases (though we may need to increase baseline specs back to initial discussion anyways, but that would be during performance testing stages). Actions \u2693\ufe0e POST/GET endpoint rules: Use GET for endpoints that take no input parameters (PostgREST native parameters can still be applied via URL) Any endpoint that we accept consumer to provide parameter for should be POST Switch cardanoqueries.ha to api.koios.rest on the API docs Load balancing: Until we see additional instances, the 4 trusted instances serve as Monitoring layer. If/when we start having community instances, we could start splitting topologies to be geographically balanced - using github as source. 26Aug2021 Queries \u2693\ufe0e stake distribution: we will run the full query on regular intervals, ready for review for first iteration, will see about delta post tx cache query transaction history: transaction history query needs to be switched to populate a cached table instead need to think about how to approach inputs/outputs in the cached table (1 row per transaction with json objects for inputs/outputs or multiple rows for tx hash) address_txs: this endpoint should bring back list of txs, and have provision to use after and before block hash - lightweight against public schema pool cache table: cached table to aggregate info from all the pool tables together (pool_metadata, pool_hash, pool_update...) the cached data should include the full history of all pools as well as the current state (latest pool update) will then be used for (most likely) all pool related endpoints without the need for joins Transaction submission feature \u2693\ufe0e a post endpoint separate from gREST ones (different port), proxy'd over haproxy using same health check script appended for node will receive signed transactions in 2 formats (file and cbor) and use cardano-submit-api or CLI to submit them to the blockchain respectively use cases are mostly light wallets, and third-party wallets or CNTools could implement such light features with it (no need for cardano-node with CNTools) 19Aug2021 DB replication presentation by Redoracle \u2693\ufe0e Proposition to move the gRest schema and tables required by the API to smaller instances that can be scaled more easily Pros and Cons to the approach discussed, worth investigating based on performance comparisons Process for upgrading our instances: \u2693\ufe0e Collaboration between trusted peers will be needed, to upgrade sequentially (3 off 6 instances, for example) Use DNS subdomain for upgraded nodes for testing Ideally upgrade processes to be done between 2 nd -4 th day of epoch to avoid overloading smaller subset in peak hours Enhance grest-poll to use arguments and seperate haproxy backends, allowing for test based reduction Queries: \u2693\ufe0e Stake distribution \u2693\ufe0e we need to implement triggers dealing with block rollbacks is tricky Priyank will make an example of his idea of how to deal with it that others can use/build upon Tx History \u2693\ufe0e Current PR to be split into two (to include value/assets and not have to return JSON that is resource intensive to generate/parse): Addr to Tx Hash list using start and end blocks Bulk Tx Hash (limit 100) query to get as much details about tx sent as possible Consider if cache table makes sense after above change. If yes, we also need triggers that can handle rollbacks 12Aug2021 PROBLEMS \u2693\ufe0e stake distribution query needs to be completed it's hard to use docker to replicate our current setup ACTIONS \u2693\ufe0e additional things to add to stake_distribution query Add logic to record and check tx based on block.id for last but 3 rd block in existing query Add a control table in grest schema to record block_hash used for last update, start time, and end time. This will act as a checkpoint for polling of queries that are not live (separate backend in haproxy) create a trigger every 2 minutes (or similar) to run stake_distribution query docker: problems with performance due to nature of IOPs and throughput usage for resources being isolated and can only access each other through sockets. still useful to test whether fully dockerized (each component isolated) can keep up to chain tip consider dockerizing all resources in one container to give new joiners a simple one liner to get up and running - this still doesn't ensure optimal performance, Tuning will still be an additional task for any infrastructure to customise setup to best results achievable 29Jul2021 PROBLEMS \u2693\ufe0e Not everyone reporting to the monitoring dashboard We don't fully understand the execution time deviations of the stake distribution query catalyst rewards are hard to isolate branch 10.1.x has been deleted on the db-sync repo people have a hard time catching up with the project after being away for a while ACTIONS \u2693\ufe0e missing instances start reporting to monitoring run stake_distribution query on multiple instances, report output of EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) catalyst rewards can be ignored until there is a clear path to get them: Fix underway using open PR if someone needs help getting the right db-sync commit, message Priyank for help as the branch is now deleted add project metadata (requirements) to grest doc header in a checklist format that folks can use to ensure their setup is up-to-date with the current project state Discussed long-term plans (will be added separately in group) 22Jul2021 PROBLEMS \u2693\ufe0e how to sync live stake between instances (or is there need for it?) ACTIONS \u2693\ufe0e Team catch live stake distributions in a separate table (in our grest schema) these queries can run on a schedule response comes from the instance with the latest data other approaches: possibly distribute pools between instances (complex approach) run full query once and only check for new/leaving delegators (probably impossible because of existing delegator UTXO movements) implement monitoring of execution times for all the queries come up with a timeline for launch (next call) stress test before launch start building queries listed on Trello board Individual sync db-sync instances to commit 84226d33eed66be8e61d50b7e1dacebdc095cee9 on release/10.1.x update setups to reflect recent directory restructuring and updated instructions 15Jul2021 Introduction for new joiner - Paddy \u2693\ufe0e from Shamrock stake pool / poolpeek gRest project could be helpful for pool peek Paddy will probably run an individual instance Problems \u2693\ufe0e there is a problem with extremely high CPU usage haproxy, tuning underway. live stake query has multiple variations, and we need to figure out what is the correct one. Action Items \u2693\ufe0e Everyone should add monitoring to their instances restructure RPC query files (separate metadata in <query>.json and sql in <query>.sql ), also remove get_ prefix Add new queries from the list fix haproxy CPU usage (use nbthreads in config, tune maxconn, switch to http mode) gather multiple variations of the live stake query and ask Erik for clarification on which one is correct Start working on other queries listed on trello 09Jul2021 Deployment scripts \u2693\ufe0e Ola added automatic deployment of services to the scripts last week. We added new tasks on Trello ticket , including flags for multiple networks (guild, testnet, mainnet), haproxy service dynamically creating hosts and doc updates. Overall, the script works well with some manual interaction still required at the moment. Supported Networks \u2693\ufe0e Just for the record here, a 16GB (or even 8GB) instance is enough to support both testnet and guild networks. db-sync versioning \u2693\ufe0e We agreed to use the release/10.1.x branch which is not yet released but built to include Alonzo migrations to avoid rework later. This version does require Alonzo config and hash to be in the node's config.json . This has to be done manually and the files are available here . Once fully released, all members should rebuild the released version to ensure each instance is running the same code. DNS naming \u2693\ufe0e For the DNS setup ticket , we started to think about the instance names for the 2 DNS instances (orange in the graph). Submissions for names will be made in the Telegram group, and will probably make a poll once we have the entries finalised. Monitoring System \u2693\ufe0e Priyank started setting up the monitoring on his instance which can then easily be switched to a separate monitoring instance. We agreed to use Prometheus / Grafana combo for data source / visualisation. We'll probably need to create some custom archiving of data to keep it long term as Prometheus stores only the last 30 days of data. Next meeting \u2693\ufe0e We would like to make Friday @ 07:00 UTC the standard time and keep meetings at weekly frequency. A poll will still be created for next weeks, but if there are no objections / requests for switching the time around (which we have not had so far) we can go ahead with the making Friday the standard with polls no longer required and only reminders / Google invites sent every week. 02Jul2021 After the initial stand-up updates from participants, we went through the entire Trello board, updating/deleting existing tickets and creating some new ones. Deployment scripts \u2693\ufe0e During the last week, work has been done on deployment scripts for all services (db-sync, gRest and haproxy) -> this is now in testing with updated instructions on trello . Everybody can put their name down on the ticket to signify when the setup is complete and note down any comments for bugs/improvements. This is the main priority at the moment as it would allow us to start transferring our setups to mainnet. Switch to Mainnet \u2693\ufe0e Following on from that, we created a ticket for starting to set up mainnet instances -> we can use 32GB RAM to start and increase later. While making sure everything works against the guild network is priority, people are free to start on this as well as we anticipate we are almost ready for the switch. Supported Networks \u2693\ufe0e This brings me to another discussion point which is on which networks are to be supported. After some discussion, it was agreed to keep beefy servers for mainnet, and have small independent instances for testnet maintained by those interested, while guild instance is pretty lightweight and useful to keep. Monitoring System \u2693\ufe0e The ticket for creating a centralised monitoring system was discussed and updated. I would say it would be good to have at least a basic version of the system in place around the time we switch to mainnet. The system could eventually serve for: - analysis of instance - performances and subsequent tuning - endpoints usage - anticipation of system requirements increases - etc. I would say that this should be an important topic of the next meeting to come up with an approach on how we will structure this system so that we can start building it in time for mainnet switch. Handling SSL \u2693\ufe0e Enabling SSL was agreed to not be required by each instance, but is optional and documentation should be created for how to automate the process of renewing SSL certificates for those wishing to add it to their instance. The end user facing endpoints \"Instance Checker\" will of course be SSL-enabled. Next meeting \u2693\ufe0e We somewhat agreed to another meeting next week again at the same time, but some participants aren't 100% for availability. Friday at 07:00 UTC might be a good standard time we hold on to, but I will make a poll like last time so that we can get more info before confirming the meeting. 25Jun2021 Meeting Structure \u2693\ufe0e As this was the first meeting, at the start we discussed about the meeting structure. In general, we agreed to something like listed below, but this can definitely change in the future: 1) 2-liner (60s) round the table stand-ups by everyone to sync up on what they were doing / are planning to do / mention struggles etc. This itself often sparks discussions. 2) going through the Trello board tasks with the intention of discussing and possbily assigning them to individuals / smaller groups (maybe 1-2-3 people choose to work together on a single task) Stand-ups \u2693\ufe0e We then proceeded to give a status of where we are individually in terms of what's been done, a summary below: Homer, Ola, Markus, Priyank and Damjan have all set up their dbsync + gRest endpoints against guild network and added to topology. Ola laid down the groundwork for CNTools to integrate with API endpoints created so far. Markus has created the systemd scripts and will add them soon to repo Damjan is tracking live stake query that includes payment + stake address, but is awaiting fix on dbsync for pool refund (contextual reserves -> account) , also need to validate reserve -> MIR certs Priyank created initial haproxy settings for polls done, need to complete agent based on design finalisation Main discussion points \u2693\ufe0e Directory structure on the repo -> General agreement is to have anything related to db-sync/postgREST separated from the current cnode-helper-scripts directory. We can finalise the end locations of files a bit later, for now intent should be to simply add them all to /files/dbsync folder. prereqs.sh addendum can be done once artifacts are finalised (added a Trello ticket for tracking). DNS/haproxy configurations: We have two options: a. controlled approach for endpoints - wherein there is a layer of haproxy that will load balance and ensure tip being in sync for individual providers (individuals can provide haproxy OR gRest instances). b. completely decentralised - each client to maintain haproxy endpoint, and fails over to other node if its not up to recent tip. I think that in general, it was agreed to use a hybrid approach. Details are captured in diagram here . DNS endpoint can be reserved post initial testing of haproxy-agent against mainnet nodes. Internal monitoring system This would be important and useful and has not been mentioned before this meeting (as far as I know). Basically, a system for monitoring all of our instances together and also handling alerts. Not only for ensuring good quality of service, but also for logging and inspection of short- and long-term trends to better understand what's happening. A ticket is added to trello board Next meeting \u2693\ufe0e All in all, I think we saw that there is need for these meetings as there are a lot of things to discuss and new ideas come up (like the monitoring system). We went for over an hour (~1h15min) and still didn't have enough time to go through the board, we basically only touched the DNS/haproxy part of the board. This tells me that we are in a stage where more frequent meetings are required, weekly instead of biweekly, as we are in the initial stage and it's important to build things right from the start rather than having to refactor later on. With that, the participants in general agreed to another meeting next week, but this will be confirmed in the TG chat and the times can be discussed then.","title":"GRest meet summaries"},{"location":"grest-meets/#grest-meeting-summaries","text":"Thank you all for joining and contributing to the project Below you can find a short summary of every GRest meeting held, both for logging purposes and for those who were not able to attend.","title":"GRest Meeting summaries"},{"location":"grest-meets/#participants","text":"Participant 16Sep2021 02Sep2021 26Aug2021 19Aug2021 12Aug2021 29Jul2021 22Jul2021 15Jul2021 09Jul2021 02Jul2021 25Jun2021 Damjan Homer Markus Ola RdLrT Red Papacarp Paddy GimbaLabs 16Sep2021","title":"Participants:"},{"location":"grest-meets/#scheduling-running-update-queries","text":"Postgres triggers are synchronous so they slow down db-sync Decided to explore crontab for query scheduling instead","title":"Scheduling running update queries"},{"location":"grest-meets/#refactor-of-queries","text":"Discussed how to structure RPC endpoints and what each should include Details have been captured in the Trello board","title":"Refactor of queries"},{"location":"grest-meets/#postgres-tuning","text":"Discussed possible tunings to the postgres config Probably reducing WAL usage 02Sep2021","title":"postgres tuning"},{"location":"grest-meets/#updates","text":"making good progress on the website (koios.rest) - great job Markus! query tickets are now well structured and put into sections (Account, Pool, Transactions...) on the Trello board - nice work Priyank/Ola!","title":"Updates"},{"location":"grest-meets/#queries","text":"Transaction cache table: We would like to avoid 'handling' rollbacks in that table, instead simply dump if multiple entries for a transaction, as it can have much higher combination and volume to process - especially post a node/postgres/dbsync restart.

I think that in general, it was agreed to use a hybrid approach. Details are captured in diagram here . DNS endpoint can be reserved post initial testing of haproxy-agent against mainnet nodes. Internal monitoring system This would be important and useful and has not been mentioned before this meeting (as far as I know).

Please verify if it is required for your use as mentioned here . Ensure the Pre-Requisites are in place before you proceed. The Cardano DB Sync relies on an existing PostgreSQL server. To keep the focus on building dbsync tool, and not how to setup postgres itself, you can refer to Sample Local PostgreSQL Server Deployment instructions for setting up a Postgres instance. Specifically, we expect the PGPASSFILE environment variable is set as per the instructions in the sample guide, for db-sync to be able to connect. Build Instructions \u2693\ufe0e Clone the repository \u2693\ufe0e Execute the below to clone the cardano-db-sync repository to $HOME/git folder on your system: cd ~/git git clone https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync cd cardano-db-sync Build Cardano DB Sync \u2693\ufe0e You can use the instructions below to build the latest release of cardano-db-sync . git fetch --tags --all git pull # Include the cardano-crypto-praos and libsodium components for db-sync # On CentOS 7 (GCC 4.8.5) we should also do # echo -e \"package cryptonite\\n flags: -use_target_attributes\" >> cabal.project.local # Replace tag against checkout if you do not want to build the latest released version git checkout $( curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync/releases/latest | jq -r .tag_name ) # Use `-l` argument if you'd like to use system libsodium instead of IOG fork of libsodium while compiling $CNODE_HOME /scripts/cabal-build-all.sh The above would copy the binaries into ~/.cabal/bin folder. Prepare DB for sync \u2693\ufe0e Now that binaries are available, let's create our database (when going through breaking changes, you may need to use --recreatedb instead of --createdb used for the first time. Again, we expect that PGPASSFILE environment variable is already set (refer to the top of this guide for sample instructions): cd ~/git/cardano-db-sync # scripts/postgresql-setup.sh --dropdb #if exists already, will fail if it doesnt - thats OK scripts/postgresql-setup.sh --createdb # Password: # Password: # All good! Verify you can see \"All good!\" as above! Create Symlink to schema folder \u2693\ufe0e DBSync instance requires the schema files from the git repository to be present and available to the dbsync instance. You can either clone the ~/git/cardano-db-sync/schema folder OR create a symlink to the folder and make it available to the startup command we will be using. We will use the latter in sample below: ln -s ~/git/cardano-db-sync/schema $CNODE_HOME /guild-db/schema Restore using Snapshot \u2693\ufe0e If you're running a testnet or mainnet instance of dbsync, you might want to consider use of dbsync snapshots as documented here . The snapshot files for latest epoch for mainnet as well as testnet are available via links in release notes . At high-level, this would involve steps as below (read and update paths as per your environment): # Replace the actual link below with the latest one from release notes wget https://update-cardano-mainnet.iohk.io/cardano-db-sync/12/db-sync-snapshot-schema-12-block-6764999-x86_64.tgz -O /tmp/dbsyncsnap.tgz rm -rf ${ CNODE_HOME } /guild-db/ledger-state ; mkdir -p ${ CNODE_HOME } /guild-db/ledger-state cd - ; cd ~/git/cardano-db-sync scripts/postgresql-setup.sh --restore-snapshot /tmp/dbsyncsnap.tgz ${ CNODE_HOME } /guild-db/ledger-state # The restore may take a while, please be patient and do not interrupt the restore process. Once restore is successful, you may delete the downloaded snapshot as below: # rm -f /tmp/dbsyncsnap.tgz Test running dbsync manually at terminal \u2693\ufe0e In order to verify that you can run dbsync, before making a start - you'd want to ensure that you can run it interactively once. To do so, try the commands below: cd $CNODE_HOME /scripts export PGPASSFILE = $CNODE_HOME /priv/.pgpass ./dbsync.sh You can monitor logs if needed via parallel session using tail -10f $CNODE_HOME/logs/dbsync.json .

Please verify if it is required for your use as mentioned here Ensure that you have setup DBSync and that it is in sync atleast to Mary fork before you proceed. IF you're participating in Koios services, ensure that you're using latest dbsync release What is gRest \u2693\ufe0e gRest is an open source implementation of a query layer built over dbsync using PostgREST and HAProxy . The package is built as part of Koios team's efforts to unite community individual stream of work together and give back a more aligned structure to query dbsync and adopt standardisation to queries utilising open-source tooling as well as collaboration. In addition to these, there are also accessibility features to deploy rules for failover, do healthchecks, set up priorities, have ability to prevent DDoS attacks, provide timeouts, report tips for analysis over a longer period, etc - which can prove to be really useful when performing any analysis for instances. Note that the scripts below do allow for provisioning ogmios integration too, but Ogmios does not provide advanced session management for a server-client architecture in absence of a middleware. The availability for ogmios from monitoring instance is restricted to avoid ability to DDoS an instance. Components \u2693\ufe0e PostgREST : An RPC JSON interface for any PostgreSQL database (in our case, database served via cardano-db-sync ) to provide a RESTful Web Service. The endpoints of PostgREST in itself are essentially the table/functions defined in elected schema via grest config file. You can read more about advanced query syntax using PostgREST API here , but we will provide a simpler view using examples towards the end of the page. It is an easy alternative - with almost no overhead as it directly serves the underlying database as an API, as compared to Cardano GraphQL component (which may often have lags). Some of the other advantages of PostgREST over graphql based projects are also performance, being stateless, 0 overhead, support for JWT / native Postgres DB authentication against the Rest Interface as well. HAProxy : An easy gateway proxy that automatically provides failover/basic DDoS protection, specify rules management for load balancing, setup multiple frontend/backends, provide easy means to have TLS enabled for public facing instances, etc. You may alter the settings for proxy layer as per your SecOps preferences. This component is optional (eg: if you prefer to expose your PostgREST server itself, you can do so using similar steps below). Setup gRest services \u2693\ufe0e To start with you'd want to ensure your current shell session has access to Postgres credentials, continuing from examples from the above mentioned Sample Postgres deployment guide . cd $CNODE_HOME /priv PGPASSFILE = $CNODE_HOME /priv/.pgpass psql cexplorer Ensure that you can connect to your Postgres DB fine using above (quit from psql once validated using \\q ). As part of prereqs.sh execution, you'd find setup-grest.sh file made available in ${CNODE_HOME}/scripts folder, which will help you automate installation of PostgREST, HAProxy as well as brings in latest queries/functions provided via Koios to your instances. Warning As of now, gRest services are in alpha stage - while can be utilised, please remember there may be breaking changes and every collaborator is expected to work with the team to keep their instances up-to-date using alpha branch. Familiarise with the usage options for the setup script , the syntax can be viewed as below: cd \" ${ CNODE_HOME } \" /scripts ./setup-grest.sh -h # # Usage: setup-grest.sh [-f] [-i [p][r][m][c][d]] [-u] [-b <branch>] # # Install and setup haproxy, PostgREST, polling services and create systemd services for haproxy, postgREST and dbsync # # -f Force overwrite of all files including normally saved user config sections # -i Set-up Components individually. If this option is not specified, components will only be installed if found missing (eg: -i prcd) # p Install/Update PostgREST binaries by downloading latest release from github. # r (Re-)Install Reverse Proxy Monitoring Layer (haproxy) binaries and config # m Install/Update Monitoring agent scripts # c Overwrite haproxy, postgREST configs # d Overwrite systemd definitions # -u Skip update check for setup script itself # -q Run all DB Queries to update on postgres (includes creating grest schema, and re-creating views/genesis table/functions/triggers and setting up cron jobs) # -b Use alternate branch of scripts to download - only recommended for testing/development (Default: master) # To run the setup with typical options, you may want to use: ./setup-grest.sh -f -q Similarly - if instead, you'd like to re-install all components as well as force overwrite all configs and queries, you may run: ./setup-grest.sh -f -i prmcd -q Another example could be to preserve your config, but only update queries using an alternate branch (eg: let's say you want to try the tag koios-1.0.0 ). To do so, you may run: ./setup-grest.sh -q -b koios-1.0.0 Please ensure to follow the on-screen instructions, if any (for example restarting deployed services, or updating configs to specify correct target postgres URLs/enable TLS/add peers etc in ${CNODE_HOME}/priv/grest.conf and ${CNODE_HOME}/files/haproxy.cfg ). The default ports used will make haproxy instance available at port 8053 or 8453 if TLS is enabled (you might want to enable firewall rule to open this port to services you would like to access). If you want to prevent unauthenticated access to grest schema, uncomment the jwt-secret and specify a custom secret-token . Enable TLS on HAProxy \u2693\ufe0e In order to enable SSL on your haproxy, all you need to do is edit the file ${CNODE_HOME}/files/haproxy.cfg and update the frontend app section to disable normal bind and enable ssl bind. server.pem referred below should be a chain containing server TLS certificate, signing certificates (intermediate/root) and private key. Make sure to replace the hostname to the CNAME/SAN used to create your TLS certificate. If you're not familiar with how to configure TLS OR would not like to buy one, you can find tips on how to create a TLS certificate for free via LetsEncrypt using tutorials here . Once you do have a TLS Certificate generated, you need to chain the private key and full chain cert together in a file - /etc/ssl/server.pem in example below: frontend app bind 0.0.0.0:8053 http-request set-log-level silent http-request replace-value Host (.*):8053 servername.koios.rest:8453 redirect scheme https code 301 if !{ ssl_fc } frontend app-secured bind :8453 ssl crt /etc/ssl/server.pem no-sslv3 http-request set-log-level silent acl srv_down nbsrv(grest_postgrest) le 1 acl is_wss hdr(Upgrade) -i websocket http-request use-service prometheus-exporter if { path /metrics } Restart haproxy service for changes to take effect. Performance Tuning Considerations \u2693\ufe0e While the defaults on your system should not cause you any trouble, note that haproxy relies on ephemeral ports available on your system to be able to redirect frontend requests to backend servers. The four important configuration settings in your /etc/sysctl.conf files would be: net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range=\"1024 65534\" net.core.somaxconn=65534 net.ipv4.tcp_rmem=4096 16060 64060 net.ipv4.tcp_wmem=4096 16384 262144 Again, defaults should be fine for minimal usage, you do not need to tinker with above unless you expect a very high amount of load on your frontend. We intentionally do not set these for you as system tuning activities should be done very carefully, understanding what you're modifying and their impacts - these would be part of your SysOps + SecOps practices. Validation \u2693\ufe0e With the setup, you also have a checkstatus.sh script, which will query the Postgres DB instance via haproxy (coming through postgREST), and only show an instance up if the latest block in your DB instance is within 180 seconds. Important While currently the HAProxy config only checks for tip, there will be test cases added for validating each endpoint in future. If you'd like to participate in joining to the elastic cluster via Koios, please raise a PR request by editing topology files in this folder to do so!! If you were using guild network, you could do a couple of very basic sanity checks as per below: To query active stake for pool pool1z2ry6kxywgvdxv26g06mdywynvs7jj3uemnxv273mr5esukljsr in epoch 122 , we can execute the below: curl -d _pool_bech32 = pool1z2ry6kxywgvdxv26g06mdywynvs7jj3uemnxv273mr5esukljsr -d _epoch_no = 122 -s http://localhost:8053/rpc/pool_active_stake ## {\"active_stake_sum\" : 19409732875} To check latest owner key(s) for a given pool pool1z2ry6kxywgvdxv26g06mdywynvs7jj3uemnxv273mr5esukljsr , you can execute the below: curl -d _pool_bech32 = pool1z2ry6kxywgvdxv26g06mdywynvs7jj3uemnxv273mr5esukljsr -s http://localhost:8050/rpc/pool_owners ## [{\"owner\" : \"stake_test1upx5p04dn3t6dvhfh27744su35vvasgaaq565jdxwlxfq5sdjwksw\"}, {\"owner\" : \"stake_test1uqak99cgtrtpean8wqwp7d9taaqkt9gkkxga05m5azcg27chnzfry\"}] You may want to explore what all endpoints come out of the box, and test them out, to do so - refer to API documentation for OpenAPI3 documentation. Each endpoint has a pre-filled example for mainnet and connects by default to primary Koios endpoint, allowing you to test endpoints and if needed - grab the curl commands to start testing yourself against your local or remote instances. Participating in Koios Cluster as instance Provider \u2693\ufe0e If you're interested to participate in decentralised infrastructure by providing an instance, there are a few additional steps you'd need: Enable ports for your HAProxy instance (default: 8053), gRest Exporter service (default: 8059) and (optionally) submit API instance (default: 8090) against the monitoring instance (do not need to open these ports to internet) of corresponding network. Ensure that each of the service above is listening on your public IP address (for instance, submitapi.sh might need to be edited to change HOSTADDR to 0.0.0.0 and restarted).

There is no connection or constraint between the TopologyUpdater Relay subscription and the BlockPerf analysis. BlockPerf is even designed to work outside the cnTools suite. The results of these data are a good basis to make optimizations and to evaluate which changes were useful or might by required to improve the performance compared to other relay nodes.","title":"Block propagation traces"},{"location":"Scripts/blockperf/#installation","text":"The script is best run as a background process.

Ensure the Pre-Requisites are in place before you proceed. cncli.sh is a script to download and deploy CNCLI created and maintained by Andrew Westberg. It's a community-based CLI tool written in RUST for low-level cardano-node communication. Usage is optional and no script is dependent on it. The main features include: PING - Validates that the remote server is on the given network and returns its response time. Utilized by gLiveView for peer analysis if available. SYNC - Connects to a node (local or remote) and synchronizes blocks to a local sqlite database. VALIDATE - Validates that a block hash or partial block hash is on-chain. LEADERLOG - Calculates a stakepool's expected slot list. On the mainnet and the official testnet, the next epoch's leader schedule is available 1.5 days before the end of the epoch ( firstSlotOfNextEpoch - (3 * k / f) ). SENDTIP - Send node tip to PoolTool for network analysis and to show that your node is alive and well with a green badge. SENDSLOTS - Securely sends PoolTool the number of slots you have assigned for an epoch and validates the correctness of your past epochs. Installation \u2693\ufe0e cncli.sh script's main functions, sync , leaderlog , validate and PoolTool sendslots / sendtip are not meant to be run manually, but instead deployed as systemd services that run in the background to do the block scraping and validation automatically. Additional commands exist for manual execution to initiate the sqlite db, filling the blocklog DB with all blocks created by the pool known to the blockchain, migration of old cntoolsBlockCollector JSON blocklog, and re-validation of blocks and leaderlogs. See usage output below for a complete list of available commands. The script works in tandem with Log Monitor to provide faster adopted status but mainly to catch slots the node is leader for but are unable to create a block for. These are marked as invalid. Blocklog will however work fine without the logMonitor service and CNCLI is able to handle everything except catching invalid blocks. Run the latest version of prereqs.sh with prereqs.sh -c to download and install RUST and CNCLI. IOG fork of libsodium required by CNCLI is automatically compiled by CNCLI build process. If a previous installation is found, RUST and CNCLI will be updated to the latest version. Run deploy-as-systemd.sh to deploy the systemd services that handle all the work in the background. Six systemd services in total are deployed whereof four are related to CNCLI. See above for the different purposes they serve. If you want to disable some of the deployed services, run sudo systemctl disable <service> cnode.service (main cardano-node launcher) cnode-cncli-sync.service cnode-cncli-leaderlog.service cnode-cncli-validate.service cnode-cncli-ptsendtip.service cnode-cncli-ptsendslots.service cnode-logmonitor.service (see Log Monitor ) Configuration \u2693\ufe0e You can override the values in the script at the User Variables section shown below.

Set required user variables according to Configuration section. ( optional ) If a previous blocklog db exist created by cntoolsBlockCollector, run this command to migrate json storage to new SQLite DB: $CNODE_HOME/scripts/cncli.sh migrate <path> where is the location to the directory containing all blocks_ .json files. Start deployed services with: sudo systemctl start cnode-cncli-sync.service (starts leaderlog , validate & ptsendslots automatically) sudo systemctl start cnode-logmonitor.service sudo systemctl start cnode-cncli-ptsendtip.service ( optional but recommended ) alternatively restart the main service that will trigger a start of all services with: sudo systemctl restart cnode.service Run init command to fill the db with all blocks made by your pool known to the blockchain $CNODE_HOME/scripts/cncli.sh init Enjoy full blocklog automation and visit View Blocklog section for instructions on how to show blocks from the blocklog DB.

You can update KOIOS_API env variable to connect to a local instance of koios (open source and incentivises all to build a decentralised query layer) if you'd not like to connect to remote instance. Visit the https://www.koios.rest/ for more information about Koios or check out the API documentation at https://api.koios.rest .

Changelog truncated up to v6.0.0. Minor and patch version changelog entries merged with next major release changelog. [8.1.1] - 2021-03-30 \u2693\ufe0e Fixed \u2693\ufe0e Relay registration condition Version number [8.1.0] - 2021-03-26 \u2693\ufe0e Added \u2693\ufe0e IPv6 support in pool registration/modification Changed \u2693\ufe0e Wallet delegation now lets you specify Pool ID in addition to local CNTools pool instead of previous cold.vkey cbor string A couple of functions regarding number validation moved to common env file Code adapted for changes in ledger-state dump used by 'Pool >> Show' Fixed \u2693\ufe0e Backup & restore now exclude gpg encrypted keys from online backup and suppression of false alarms [8.0.2] - 2021-03-15 \u2693\ufe0e Fixed \u2693\ufe0e Bump cardano-hw-cli minimum version to 1.2.0 Add Ledger Cardano app version check with minimum enforced version of 2.2.0 Add Trezor firmware check with minimum enforced version of 2.3.6 [8.0.1] - 2021-03-05 \u2693\ufe0e Fixed \u2693\ufe0e Add BASH version check, version 4.4 or newer required [8.0.0] - 2021-02-28 \u2693\ufe0e Added \u2693\ufe0e Multi Asset Token compatibility added throughout all CNTools operations. Sending Ada and custom tokens is done through the normal 'Funds >> Send' operation Changed \u2693\ufe0e Metadata moved to a new Advanced section used for devs/advanced operations not normally used by SPOs. Accessed by enabling developer/advanced mode in cntools.config or by providing runtime flag '-a' Redesign of backup and restore. Deletion of private keys moved from backup to new section under Advanced Backup now only contain content of priv folder (files & scripts folders dropped) Restore operation now restore directly to priv folder instead of a random user selected folder to make restore easier and better. Before restore, a new full backup of priv folder is made and stored encrypted in priv/archive Fixed \u2693\ufe0e JQ limitation workaround for large numbers Dialog compatibility improvement by preventing dialog launching a subshell on some systems causing dialog not to run [7.1.6] - 2021-02-10 \u2693\ufe0e Update curl commands when file isnt downloaded correctly (to give correct return code) [7.1.5] - 2021-02-03 \u2693\ufe0e Changed \u2693\ufe0e Guild Announcement/Support Telegram channel added to CNTools GUI Fixed \u2693\ufe0e Fix for a special case using an incomplete wallet (missing stake keys) [7.1.4] - 2021-02-01 \u2693\ufe0e Fixed \u2693\ufe0e Typo in function name after harmonization between scripts [7.1.3] - 2021-01-30 \u2693\ufe0e Fixed \u2693\ufe0e Vacuumlabs cardano-hw-cli 1.1.3 support, now the minimum supported version Improved error handling [7.1.1] - 2021-01-29 \u2693\ufe0e Changed \u2693\ufe0e Minor change to future update notification for common env file [7.1.0] - 2021-01-29 \u2693\ufe0e Changed \u2693\ufe0e Remove ChainDB metrics references to align with cardano-node 1.25.1 Moved some functions to env for reusability between tools [7.0.2] - 2021-01-17 \u2693\ufe0e Changed \u2693\ufe0e Re-add the option in offline workflow to use wallet folder that only contains stake keys for multi-owner pools Fixed \u2693\ufe0e Verification of signing key in offline mode for extended signing keys (mnemonics imported wallets) [7.0.1] - 2021-01-13 \u2693\ufe0e Changed \u2693\ufe0e Add prompt before updating common env file, instead of auto-update [7.0.0] - 2021-01-11 \u2693\ufe0e Though mostly unchanged in the user interface, this is a major update with most of the code re-written/touched in the back-end. Only the most noticeable changes added to changelog. Added \u2693\ufe0e HW Wallet support through Vacuumlabs cardano-hw-cli (Ledger Nano X/S & Trezor T) Vacuumlabs cardano-hw-cli added as build option to prereqs.sh, option '-w' incl Ledger udev rules. Software from Vacuumlabs and Ledger app still early in development and may contain limitations that require workarounds. Users are recommended to familiarise their usage using test wallets first. Because of HW wallet support, transaction signing has been re-designed. For CLI and HW wallet pool reg, raw tx is first witnessed by all signing keys separately and then assembled and signed instead of signing directly with all signing keys. But for all other HW wallet transactions, signing is done directly without first witnessing. Requires updated Cardano app in Ledger/Trezor set to be released in January 2021 to use in pool registration/modification. Option added to disable Dialog for file/dir input in cntools.config Changed \u2693\ufe0e Logging completely re-designed from the ground. Previous selective logging wasn't very useful. All output(almost) now outputted to both the screen and to a timestamped log file. One log file is created per CNTools session. Old log file archived in logs/archive subfolder and last 10 log files kept, rest is pruned on CNTools startup. DEBUG : Verbose output, most output printed on screen is logged as debug messages except explicitly disabled, like menu printing. INFO : Informational and the most important output. ACTION : e.g cardano-cli executions etc ERROR : error messages and stderr output Verbosity setting in cntools.config removed. Offline workflow now use a single JSON transaction file holding all data needed. This allows us to bake in additional data in the JSON file in addition to the tx body to make it much more clear what the offline transaction do. Like signing key verification, transaction data like fee, source wallet, pool name etc. It also lets the user know on offline computer what signing keys is needed to sign the transaction. Sign Tx moved to Transaction >> Sign Submit Tx moved to Transaction >> Submit Fixed \u2693\ufe0e Remove intermediate prompt for showing changelog, so that it's directly visible. [6.3.1] - 2020-12-14 \u2693\ufe0e Fixed \u2693\ufe0e Array expansion not correctly handled for multi-owner signing keys KES rotation output fix in OFFLINE mode, op.cert should be copied, not cold.counter Output and file explorer workflow redesigned a bit for a better flow formatLovelace() thousand separator fix after forcing locale to C.UTF-8 in env formatAda() function added to pretty print pledge and cost w/o Lovelace [6.3.0] - 2020-12-03 \u2693\ufe0e Changed \u2693\ufe0e printTable function replaced with bash printf due to compatibility issues Improved workflow in pool registration/modification for relays and multi-owner. Standardized names for wallet and pool files/folders moved to env file from cntools.config Compatibility with 1.24.2 node (accomodate ledger schema and CLI changes), use 1.24.2 as baseline Move version check to env Fixed \u2693\ufe0e Error output for prerequisite checks [6.2.1] - 2020-11-28 \u2693\ufe0e Changed \u2693\ufe0e Compatibility changes for cardano-node 1.23.0, now minimum version to run CNTools 6.2.1 Cleanup of old code [6.2.0] - (alpha branch) \u2693\ufe0e Added \u2693\ufe0e Ability to post metadata on-chain, e.g. (but not limited to) Adams https://vote.crypto2099.io/ Changed \u2693\ufe0e Blocks view updated to adapt to the added CNCLI integration and changes made to block collector(logMonitor) CNCLI Log Monitor chattr file locking now optional to use, a new setting in cntools.config added for it. Fixed \u2693\ufe0e unnecessary bech32 conversion in wallet import (non-breaking) [6.1.0] - 2020-10-22 \u2693\ufe0e Added \u2693\ufe0e Wallet de-registration with key deposit refund (new cntools.config parameter, WALLET_STAKE_DEREG_FILENAME) Default values loaded for all config variables if omitted/missing in cntools.config Changed \u2693\ufe0e Prometheus node metrics replaced with EKG Allow and handle missing pool.config in pool >> modify and show Cancel and return added in several helper functions if cardano-cli execution fails Various tweaks to the output Fixed \u2693\ufe0e Script execution permissions after internal update Handle redirect in curl metadata fetch [6.0.3] - 2020-10-16 \u2693\ufe0e Fixed \u2693\ufe0e Shelley epoch transition calculation used the wrong byron metric in the calculation [6.0.2] - 2020-10-16 \u2693\ufe0e Fixed \u2693\ufe0e Internal update had the wrong path to env file breaking automatic update, please use prereqs.sh to update Fix in 6.0.1 broke pool id retrieval, now compatible with both pre and post cardano-node 1.21.2 syntax. [6.0.1] - 2020-10-16 \u2693\ufe0e Fixed \u2693\ufe0e As per change to cardano-cli syntax, pool ID requires --cold-verification-key-file instead of --verification-key-file [6.0.0] - 2020-10-15 \u2693\ufe0e This is a major release with a lot of changes. It is highly recommended that you familiarise yourself with the usage for Hybrid or Online v/s Offline mode on a testnet environment before doing it on production. Please visit https://cardano-community.github.io/guild-operators/upgrade for details. Added \u2693\ufe0e Allow CNTools to operate in offline mode. Offline features include: Simplified Walet Show/List menu Wallet delete without balance check option Pool KES Rotation Sign a staging transaction. Allow creation of staging tx files using ttl as input in an online/offline-hybrid mode, that can be sent to offline server to sign. To Transfer Funds Withdraw Rewards Delegate Register/Modify/Retire pool Allow import of a signed transaction to submit in online mode Allow import of 15/24 words based wallets. Note that you'd need cardano-address and bech32 in yout $PATH to use this feature (available if you rebuild cardano-node using updated cabal-build-all.sh ), reusing guide from @ilap . Backup now offer the ability to create an online backup without wallet payment/stake and pool cold sign keys Regular(offline) backup now display a warning if wallet payment/stake and pool cold sign keys are missing due to being deleted manually or by previous backup Retire notification in pool >> show Sanity check before launching a second instance of cnode.sh Doc update to run cnode.sh as a systemd service Use secure remove ( srm ) when available when deleting files. Balance check notification added before wallet selection menus are shown to know that work is done in the background Ability to select a different pool owner and reward wallet Multi-owner support using stake vkey/skey files Added TIMEOUT_LEDGER_STATE(default 300s) in cntools.config to be used instead of static 60 seconds for querying shelley ledger-state. Option to delete private keys after successful backup itnRewards.sh script to claim ITN rewards incl docs update More explicit error messages at startup Basic sanity checks for socket file Backup & Restore of wallets, pools and configuration files External KES rotation script using CNTools library Add few flags to control prereqs to allow skipping overwriting files, deploying OS packages, etc cntools.sh: Drop an error if log not found, indicating config with no JSON being used Changed \u2693\ufe0e Improved trap/exit handling Allow thousand separator( , ) in user input for sending ADA and pledge/cost at pool registration to make it easier to count the zeros User input for files and directories now open a dialog gui to make it easier to find the correct path CNTools now uses and works with cardano-node 1.19.0 , please upgrade if you're not using this version. Use manual calculation based on slot tip to get KES period Removed ledger dump dependency from Pool Register, Modify, Retire and List. The cost of the ledger dump is too high, replaced with a simple check if pools registration certificate exist in pool folder Pool >> Show|Delegators are now the only options dumping the ledger-state Wallet vkeys no longer encrypted as skeys are the only ones in need of protection Update command change (change applied after this release is active): Minor/Patch release: it will warn, backup and replace CNTools script files including cntools.config Major release: No change, prompt user to backup and run prereqs.sh according to instructions. Troubleshooting improvements: Split 'config in json format' and 'hasPrometheus' checks Output node sync stats if Shelley transition epoch is to be calculated Protocol parameters output check to give an improved error message Pool >> Show view updated to show modified pool values if Pool >> Modify has been used to update pool parameters The section has also been updated to make it a little bit easier to read Pool >> Delegators view also use updated pledge value if a pool modification has been registered to check if pledge is met Use mainnet as default, since other testnets are either retired or not being maintained :( Backup original files when doing upgrades, so that users do not lose their changes. Major update description updated env file update removed from minor update Prometheus metrics used for various functions and now required to run CNTools, enabled by default Changed references to ptn0 to generalize the usage Change CNTools changelog heading format - +1 sublevels for headings (used by newer documentation) Delegators previously displayed in Pool >> Show now moved to its own menu option This is to de-clutter and because it takes time to parse this data from ledger-state stake.cert no longer encrypted in wallet Meta description now has a limit of 255 chars to match smash server limit ledger-state timeout increased to 60s Update ptn0 config to align with hydra config as much as possible, while keeping trace options on moved update check to be one of the first things CNTools does after start to be able to show critical changes before anything else runs. Parse node logs to check the transition from Byron to shelley era, and save the epoch for transition in db folder. This is required for calculating KES keys. Please make sure to use config files created by the prereqs.sh, or enable JSON loggers for your config . Update cnode.sh.templ to archive logs every time node is restart, this ensures that we're not searching for previous log history when network was changed. Network being changed would automatically deduce db folder was deleted. Update default network to MC3 Removed \u2693\ufe0e Pool >> Delegators removed. If/when a better option than dumping and parsing ledger-state dump arise re-adding it will be considered. Utilize the community explorers listed at https://cardano-community.github.io/support-faq/explorers POOL_PLEDGECERT_FILENAME removed from config, WALLET_DELEGCERT_FILENAME is used instead for delegation cert to pool, no need to keep a separate cert in pool folder for this, its the wallet that is delegated. Redundant sections in guide Stale delegate.counter Fixed \u2693\ufe0e Check pool >> show stake distribution showing up as always 0. KES expiration calculation Slot interval calculation Custom vname replacement(when using prereqs.sh -t ) fix for internal update Pool registration and de-registration certificates removed in case of retire/re-registration KES Expiry to use KES Period instead of Epoch duration Block Collector script adapted for cardano-node 1.19.0. Block hash is now truncated in log, issue https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/issues/1738 High cpu usage reported in a few cases when running Block Collector Depending on log level, parsing and byte64 enc each entry with jq could potentially put high load on weaker systems. Replaced with grep to only parse entries containing specific traces. Docs for creating systemd block collector service file updated to include user env in run command cardano-node 1.19.0 introduced an issue that required us to use KES as current - 1 while rotating. A new getPoolID helper function added to extract both hex and bech32 pool ID Added --output-format hex when extracting pool ID in hex format A new pool.id-bech32 file gets created if cold.vkey is available and decrypted Added error check to see if cardano-cli is in $PATH before continuing. Backup & Restore paths were failing on machines due to alnum class availability on certain interpreters. Rewards were not counted in stake and pledge Removed +i file locking on .addr files when using Wallet >> Encrypt as these are re-generated from keys and need to be writable Balance check added to Funds >> Withdraw for base address as this is used to pay the withdraw transaction fee Resolve issue with Multi Owner causing an error with new pool registration (error was due to quotes) Mainnet uses dedicated condition for slot checks Timeout moved to a variable in cntools.library KES Calculation for current KES period and KES expiration date Please re-check expiration date using Pool >> Show calc_slots to be network independent prom_host should be calculated from config file, instead of having to update a config Minor typo in menu Parse Config for virtual forks, which adds supports for MC4 CNTools block collector fix column application added as a prereq, bsdmainutils/util-linux cntoolsBlockCollector.sh get epoch using function KES count was not showing up in Katip Funds -> Delegation was broken as per recent changes in 1.17, corrected key type for delegation certificate Pool >> Show delegator rewards parsing from ledger-state Slot sync format improvement kesExpiration function to use 17 fixed byron transition epochs [5.0.0] - 2020-07-20 \u2693\ufe0e Added \u2693\ufe0e HASH_IDENTIFIER where applicable to differentiate between network modes for commands used, required due to legacy Byron considerations add ptn0-praos.json and ptn0-combinator.json to reduce confusion between formats, make prereqs default to combinator, and accept p argument to indicate praos mode. cardano-node 1.16.0 refers to txhash using quotes, sed them out show what's new at startup after update file size check for pool metadata file Add nonce in pool metadata JSON to keep registration attempts unique, avoiding one hash pointing to multiple URLs Change default network to mainnet_candidate , and add second argument (g) to run prereqs against guild network allow the use of pre-existing metadata from URL when registering or modifying pool minimum pool cost check against protocol Refresh option to home screen Ability to register multiple relay DNS A records as well as a mix of DNS A and IPv4 Valid for pool registration and modification Changed \u2693\ufe0e Default config switched to combinator instead of testnet Start maintaining seperate versions of praos and combinator config files. Add 10s timeout to wget commmands in case of issue timestamp added to pool metadata file to make every creation unique Cancel shortcut changed from [c] to [Esc] Default pool cost from 256 -> 400 slotinterval calculation to include decentralisation parameter mainnet candidate compatible slot calculation, 17 fixed byron transition epochs (needs to be fixed for mainnet) Pool metadata information to copy file as-is as well as wait for keypress to make sure file is copied before proceeding with registration. Now use internal table builder to display previous relays Instead of giving relays from previous registration as default values it will now ask if you want to re-register relays exactly as before to minimize steps and complexity Removed \u2693\ufe0e Delete cntools-updater script NODE_SOCKET_PATH config parameter(replaced by CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET_PATH) Fixed \u2693\ufe0e Slots reference was mixing up for shelley testnet in absence of a combinator network numfmt dependency removed in favor of printf formatting Vkey delegation fix due to json format switch ADA not displayed in a couple of the wallet selection menus KES calculation support for both MC and Shelley Testnet Slot tip reference calculation for shelley testnet [4.0.0] - 2020-07-13 \u2693\ufe0e Added \u2693\ufe0e Add PROTOCOL_IDENTIFIER and NETWORK_IDENTIFIER instead of harcoded entries for combinator v/s TPraos & testnet v/s magic differentiators respectively. Keep both ptn0.yaml and ptn0-combinator.yaml to keep validity with mainnet-combinator Changed \u2693\ufe0e Revert back default for Public network to Shelley_Testnet as per https://t.me/CardanoStakePoolWorkgroup/282606 [3.0.0] - 2020-07-12 \u2693\ufe0e Added \u2693\ufe0e Basic health check data on main menu Epoch, time until next epoch, node tip vs calculated reference tip and a warning if node is lagging behind. Address era and encoding to Wallet >> Show Changed \u2693\ufe0e Release 2.1.1 included a change to env file and thus require a major version bump. Modified output on Update screen slightly.

You can then move on to test the Offline Workflow . The Offline workflow means that the private keys never touch the Online node. When comfortable with both the online and offline CNTools workflow, it's time to deploy what you learnt on the mainnet. This chapter describes some common use-cases for wallet and pool creation when running CNTools in Online mode. CNTools contains much more functionality not described here. Create Wallet A wallet is needed for pledge and to pay for pool registration fee. Choose [w] Wallet and you will be presented with the following menu: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ >> WALLET ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Wallet Management ) New - create a new wallet ) Import - import a Daedalus/Yoroi 24/25 mnemonic or Ledger/Trezor HW wallet ) Register - register a wallet on chain ) De-Register - De-Register (retire) a registered wallet ) List - list all available wallets in a compact view ) Show - show detailed view of a specific wallet ) Remove - remove a wallet ) Decrypt - remove write protection and decrypt wallet ) Encrypt - encrypt wallet keys and make all files immutable ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Select Wallet Operation [n] New [i] Import [r] Register [z] De-Register [l] List [s] Show [x] Remove [d] Decrypt [e] Encrypt [h] Home Choose [n] New to create a new wallet. [i] Import can also be used to import a Daedalus/Yoroi based 15 or 24 word wallet seed Give the wallet a name CNTools will give you the wallet address. For example: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ >> WALLET >> NEW ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Name of new wallet: Test New Wallet : Test Address : addr_test1qpq5qjr774cyc6kxcwp060k4t4hwp42q43v35lmcg3gcycu5uwdwld5yr8m8fgn7su955zf5qahtrgljqfjfa4nr8jfsj4alxk Enterprise Address : addr_test1vpq5qjr774cyc6kxcwp060k4t4hwp42q43v35lmcg3gcyccuxhdka You can now send and receive Ada using the above addresses. Note that Enterprise Address will not take part in staking. Wallet will be automatically registered on chain if you choose to delegate or pledge wallet when registering a stake pool. Send some money to this wallet. Either through the faucet or have a friend send you some. The wallet must have funds in it before you can proceed. The Wallet created from here is not derived from mnemonics, please use next tab if you'd like to use a wallet that can also be accessed from Daedalus/Yoroi Import Daedalus/Yoroi/HW Wallet The Import feature of CNTools is originally based on this guide from Ilap . If you would like to use Import function to import a Daedalus/Yoroi based 15 or 24 word wallet seed, please ensure that cardano-address and bech32 bineries are available in your $PATH environment variable: bech32 --version 1.1.0 cardano-address --version 3.5.0 If the version is not as per above, please run the latest prereqs.sh from here and rebuild cardano-node as instructed here . To import a Daedalus/Yoroi wallet to CNTools, open CNTools and select the [w] Wallet option, and then select the [i] Import , the following menu will appear: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ >> WALLET >> IMPORT ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Wallet Import ) Mnemonic - Daedalus/Yoroi 24 or 25 word mnemonic ) HW Wallet - Ledger/Trezor hardware wallet ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Select Wallet operation [m] Mnemonic [w] HW Wallet [h] Home Note You can import Hardware wallet using [w] HW Wallet above, but please note that before you are able to use hardware wallet in CNTools, you need to ensure you can detect your hardware device at OS level using cardano-hw-cli Select the wallet you want to import, for Daedalus / Yoroi wallets select [m] Mnemonic : ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ >> WALLET >> IMPORT >> MNEMONIC ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Name of imported wallet: TEST 24 or 15 word mnemonic(space separated): Give your wallet a name (in this case 'TEST'), and enter your mnemonic phrase. Please ensure that you **READ* through the complete notes presented by CNTools before proceeding. Create Pool Create the necessary pool keys. From the main menu select [p] Pool ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ >> POOL ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Pool Management ) New - create a new pool ) Register - register created pool on chain using a stake wallet (pledge wallet) ) Modify - change pool parameters and register updated pool values on chain ) Retire - de-register stake pool from chain in specified epoch ) List - a compact list view of available local pools ) Show - detailed view of specified pool ) Rotate - rotate pool KES keys ) Decrypt - remove write protection and decrypt pool ) Encrypt - encrypt pool cold keys and make all files immutable ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Select Pool Operation [n] New [r] Register [m] Modify [x] Retire [l] List [s] Show [o] Rotate [d] Decrypt [e] Encrypt [h] Home Select [n] New to create a new pool Give the pool a name. In our case, we call it TEST. The result should look something like this: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ >> POOL >> NEW ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Pool Name: TEST Pool: TEST ID (hex) : 8d5a3510f18ce241115da38a1b2419ed82d308599c16e98caea1b4c0 ID (bech32) : pool134dr2y833n3yzy2a5w9pkfqeakpdxzzenstwnr9w5x6vqtnclue Register Pool Register the pool on-chain. From the main menu select [p] Pool Select [r] Register Select the pool you just created CNTools will give you prompts to set pledge, margin, cost, metadata, and relays. Enter values that are useful to you. Make sure you set your pledge low enough to insure your funds in your wallet will cover pledge plus pool registration fees. Select wallet to use as pledge wallet, Test in our case. As this is a newly created wallet, you will be prompted to continue with wallet registration. When complete and if successful, both wallet and pool will be registered on-chain. It will look something like this: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ >> POOL >> REGISTER ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Online mode - The default mode to use if all keys are available Hybrid mode - 1) Go through the steps to build a transaction file 2) Copy the built tx file to an offline node 3) Sign it using 'Sign Tx' with keys on offline node (CNTools started in offline mode '-o' without node connection) 4) Copy the signed tx file back to the online node and submit using 'Submit Tx' Selected value: [o] Online # Select pool Selected pool: TEST # Pool Parameters press enter to use default value Pledge (in Ada, default: 50,000): Margin (in %, default: 7.5): Cost (in Ada, minimum: 340, default: 340): # Pool Metadata Enter Pool's JSON URL to host metadata file - URL length should be less than 64 chars (default: https://foo.bat/poolmeta.json): Enter Pool's Name (default: TEST): Enter Pool's Ticker , should be between 3-5 characters (default: TEST): Enter Pool's Description (default: No Description): Enter Pool's Homepage (default: https://foo.com): Optionally set an extended metadata URL?

The cnode.sh script will automatically detect whether the files required to run as a block producing node are present in the $CNODE_HOME/priv/pool/<POOL_NAME> directory. Rotate KES Keys The node runs with an operational certificate, generated using the KES hot key. For security reasons, the protocol asks to re-generate (or rotate) your KES key once reaching expiry. On mainnet, this expiry is in 62 cycles of 18 hours (thus, to ask for rotation quarterly), after which your node will not be able to forge valid blocks unless rotated. To be able to rotate KES keys, your cold keys files ( cold.skey , cold.vkey and cold.counter ) need to be present on the machine where you run CNTools to rotate your KES key. To Rotate KES keys and generate the operational certificate - op.cert . From the main menu select [p] Pool Select [o] Rotate Select the pool you just created The output should look like: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ >> POOL >> ROTATE KES ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Select pool to rotate KES keys on Selected pool: TEST Pool KES keys successfully updated New KES start period : 240 KES keys will expire : 302 - 2021-09-04 11:24:31 UTC Restart your pool node for changes to take effect press any key to return to home menu Start or restart your cardano-node . If deployed as a systemd service as shown here , you can run sudo systemctl restart cnode . Ensure the node is running as a block producing (core) node. You can use gLiveView - the output at the top should say > Cardano Node - (Core - Testnet) . Alternatively, you can check the node logs in $CNODE_HOME/logs/ to see whether the node is performing leadership checks ( TraceStartLeadershipCheck , TraceNodeIsNotLeader , etc.)","title":"Common Tasks"},{"location":"Scripts/cntools/","text":"Important Ensure the Pre-Requisites are in place before you proceed. The active testers for this script use Fedora/CentOS/RHEL/Ubuntu operating systems, other OS may require customisations. The tool uses the folder structure defined here . Everyone is free to customise, but while doing so beware that you may introduce changes that may not be tested during updates. Always use Testnet/Guild network first to familiarise, read the warning/messages in full, maintain your keys/backups with passwords (no one other than yourself can retrieve the funds if you make an accident), before performing actions on mainnet. CNTools is like a swiss army knife for pool operators to simplify typical operations regarding their wallet keys and pool management. Please note that this tool only aims to simplify usual tasks for its users, but it should NOT act as an excuse to skip understanding how to manually work through things or basics of Linux operations. The skills highlighted on the home page are paramount for a stake pool operator, and so is the understanding of configuration files and network. Please ensure you've read and understood the disclaimers before proceeding. Visit the Changelog section to see progress and current release. Overview \u2693\ufe0e The tool consist of three files. cntools.sh - the main script to launch cntools. cntools.library - internal script with helper functions. In addition to the above files, there is also a dependency on the common env file. CNTools connects to your node through the configuration in the env file located in the same directory as the script. Customize env and cntools.sh files to your needs. Additionally, CNTools can integrate and enable optional functionalities based on external components: cncli.sh is a companion script with optional functionalities to run on the core node (block producer) such as monitoring created blocks, calculating leader schedules and block validation. logMonitor.sh is another companion script meant to be run together with the cncli.sh script to give a more complete picture. See CNCLI and Log Monitor sections for more details. CNTools can operate in following modes: Advanced - When CNTools is launched with -a runtime argument, this launches CNTools exposing a new Advanced menu, which allows users to manage (create/mint/burn) new assets. Online - When all wallet and pool keys are available on the hot node, use this option. This is the default mode when you start CNTools without parameters. Hybrid - When running in online mode, this option can be used in menus to create offline transaction files that can be passed to Offline CNTools to sign. Offline - When CNTools is launched with -o runtime argument, this launches CNTools with limited set of features. This mode does not require access to cardano-node . It is mainly used to create Wallet/Pool and access Transaction >> Sign to sign an offline transaction file created in Hybrid mode. Download and Update \u2693\ufe0e The update functionality is provided from within CNTools. In case of breaking changes, please follow the prompts post-upgrade. If stuck, it's always best to re-run the latest prereqs.sh before proceeding. If you have not updated in a while, it is possible that you might come from a release with breaking changes. If so, please be sure to check out the upgrade instructions. Navigation \u2693\ufe0e The scripts menu supports both arrow key navigation and shortcut key selection. The character within the square brackets is the shortcut to press for quick navigation. For other selections like wallet and pool menu that don't contain shortcuts, there is a third way to navigate. Key pressed is compared to the first character of the menu option and if there is a match the selection jumps to this location. A handy way to quickly navigate a large menu. Hardware Wallet \u2693\ufe0e CNTools include hardware wallet support since version 7.0.0 through Vacuumlabs cardano-hw-cli application. Initialize and update firmware/app on the device to the latest version before usage following the manufacturer instructions. To enable hardware support run prereqs.sh -w . This downloads and installs Vacuumlabs cardano-hw-cli including udev configuration. When a new version of Vacuumlabs cardano-hw-cli is released, run prereqs.sh -w again to update. For additional runtime options, run prereqs.sh -h . Ledger Supported devices: Nano S / Nano X Make sure the latest cardano app is installed on the device. Trezor Supported devices: Model T Make sure the latest firmware is installed on the device. In addition to this, install Trezor Bridge for your system before trying to use your Trezor device in CNTools. You can find the latest version of the bridge at https://wallet.trezor.io/#/bridge Offline Workflow \u2693\ufe0e CNTools can be run in online and offline mode. At a very high level, for working with offline devices, remember that you need to use CNTools in an online node to generate a staging transaction for the desired type of transaction, and then move the staging transaction to an offline node to sign (authorize) using the signing keys on your offline node - and then bring back the signed transaction to the online node for submission to the chain. For the offline workflow, all the wallet and pool keys should be kept on the offline node. The backup function in CNTools has an option to create a backup without private keys (sensitive signing keys) to be transferred to online node. All other files are included in the backup to be transferred to the online node. Keys excluded from backup when created without private keys: Wallet - payment.skey , stake.skey Pool - cold.skey Note that setting up an offline server requires good SysOps background (you need to be aware of how to set up your server with offline mirror repository, how to transfer files across and be fairly familiar with the disk layout of guild tools).

Customize env and cntools.sh files to your needs. Additionally, CNTools can integrate and enable optional functionalities based on external components: cncli.sh is a companion script with optional functionalities to run on the core node (block producer) such as monitoring created blocks, calculating leader schedules and block validation. logMonitor.sh is another companion script meant to be run together with the cncli.sh script to give a more complete picture. See CNCLI and Log Monitor sections for more details. CNTools can operate in following modes: Advanced - When CNTools is launched with -a runtime argument, this launches CNTools exposing a new Advanced menu, which allows users to manage (create/mint/burn) new assets. Online - When all wallet and pool keys are available on the hot node, use this option. This is the default mode when you start CNTools without parameters. Hybrid - When running in online mode, this option can be used in menus to create offline transaction files that can be passed to Offline CNTools to sign. Offline - When CNTools is launched with -o runtime argument, this launches CNTools with limited set of features. This mode does not require access to cardano-node .

At a very high level, for working with offline devices, remember that you need to use CNTools in an online node to generate a staging transaction for the desired type of transaction, and then move the staging transaction to an offline node to sign (authorize) using the signing keys on your offline node - and then bring back the signed transaction to the online node for submission to the chain. For the offline workflow, all the wallet and pool keys should be kept on the offline node.

Ensure the Pre-Requisites are in place before you proceed. Guild LiveView - gLiveView is a local monitoring tool to use in addition to remote monitoring tools like Prometheus/Grafana, Zabbix or IOG's RTView. This is especially useful when moving to a systemd deployment - if you haven't done so already - as it offers an intuitive UI to monitor the node status. The tool is independent from other files and can run as a standalone utility that can be stopped/started without affecting the status of cardano-node . Download \u2693\ufe0e If you've used prereqs.sh , you can skip this part, as this is already set up for you. The tool relies on the common env configuration file. To get current epoch blocks, the logMonitor.sh script is needed (and can be combined with CNCLI ). This is optional and Guild LiveView will function without it. Note For those who follow guild's folder structure and do not wish to run prereqs.sh , you can run the below in $CNODE_HOME/scripts folder To download the script: curl -s -o gLiveView.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cardano-community/guild-operators/master/scripts/cnode-helper-scripts/gLiveView.sh curl -s -o env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cardano-community/guild-operators/master/scripts/cnode-helper-scripts/env chmod 755 gLiveView.sh Configuration & Startup \u2693\ufe0e For most setups, it's enough to set CNODE_PORT in the env file. The rest of the variables should automatically be detected. If required, modify User Variables in env and gLiveView.sh to suit your environment (if folder structure you use is different). This should lead you to a stage where you can now start running ./gLiveView.sh in the folder you downloaded the script (the default location would be $CNODE_HOME/scripts ). Note that the script is smart enough to automatically detect when you're running as a Core or Relay and will show fields accordingly. The tool can be run in legacy mode with only standard ASCII characters for terminals with trouble displaying the box-drawing characters. Run ./gLiveView.sh -h to show available command-line parameters or permanently set it directly in script. A sample output from both core and relay together with peer analysis: Core Relay Peer Analysis Upper main section \u2693\ufe0e Displays live metrics from cardano-node gathered through the nodes EKG/Prometheus(env setting) endpoint. Epoch Progress - Epoch number and progress is live from the node while date calculation until epoch boundary is based on offline genesis parameters. Block - The nodes current block height since genesis start. Slot - The nodes current slot height since current epoch start. Density - With the current chain parameters(MainNet), a block is created roughly every 20 seconds( activeSlotsCoeff ). A slot on MainNet happens every 1 second( slotLength ), thus the max chain density can be calculated as slotLength/activeSlotsCoeff = 5% . Normally, the value should fluctuate around this value. Total Tx - The total number of transactions processed since node start. Pending Tx - The number of transactions and the bytes(total, in kb) currently in mempool to be included in upcoming blocks. Tip (ref) - Reference tip is an offline calculation based on genesis values for current slot height since genesis start. Tip (diff) / Status - Will either show node status as starting|sync xx.x% or if close to reference tip, the tip difference Tip (ref) - Tip (node) to see how far of the tip (diff value) the node is. With current parameters a slot diff up to 40 from reference tip is considered good but it should usually stay below 30. It's perfectly normal to see big differences in slots between blocks. It's the built in randomness at play. To see if a node is really healthy and staying on tip you would need to compare the tip between multiple nodes. Forks - The number of forks since node start. Each fork means the blockchain evolved in a different direction, thereby discarding blocks. A high number of forks means there is a higher chance of orphaned blocks. Peers In / Out - Shows how many connections the node has established in and out. See Peer analysis section for how to get more details of incoming and outgoing connections. Mem (RSS) - RSS is the Resident Set Size and shows how much memory is allocated to cardano-node and that is in RAM. It does not include memory that is swapped out. It does include memory from shared libraries as long as the pages from those libraries are actually in memory. It does include all stack and heap memory. Mem (Live) / (Heap) - GC (Garbage Collector) values that show how much memory is used for live/heap data. A large difference between them (or the heap approaching the physical memory limit) means the node is struggling with the garbage collector and/or may begin swapping. GC Minor / Major - Collecting garbage from \"Young space\" is called a Minor GC. Major (Full) GC is done more rarily and is a more expensive operation. Explaining garbage collection is a topic outside the scope of this documentation and google is your friend for this. Block propagation - Last delay measures the duration between when the last block was scheduled to be produced and when the node learned about it. Late blocks are blocks whose delay is larger than 5s. If the node is not synching, the number of late blocks needs to stay low. Within \u2153/5s estimates the chance of observing a delay of \u2153/5s (based on the delays observed for previous blocks). A healthy node needs to stay above 95% of blocks within 3s. Finally, served blocks counts how many blocks were fetched by \"in\" peers. If this does not increase for a long time, it means the \"in\" peers are learning about new blocks from somewhere else (and therefore this node is not contributing towards accelerating the propagation). Overall, these metrics are helpful in tweaking the topology and/or performance of the network links. Core section \u2693\ufe0e If the node is run as a core, identified by the 'forge-about-to-lead' parameter, a second core section is displayed. KES period / expiration - This section contain the current and remaining KES periods as well as a calculated date for the expiration. When getting close to expire date the values will change color. Missed slot checks - A value that show if the node have missed slots for attempting leadership checks (as absolute value and percentage since node startup). !!! info \"Missed Slot Leadership Check\" Note that while this counter should ideally be close to zero, you would often see a higher value if the node is busy (e.g. paused for garbage collection or busy with reward calculations). A consistently high percentage of missed slots would need further investigation (assistance for troubleshooting can be seeked here ), as in extremely remote cases - it can overlap with a slot that your node could be a leader for. Blocks - If CNCLI is activated to store blocks created in a blocklog DB, data from this blocklog is displayed. See linked CNCLI documentation for details regarding the different block metrics. If CNCLI is not deployed, block metrics displayed are taken from node metrics and show blocks created by the node since node start. Peer analysis \u2693\ufe0e A manual peer analysis can be triggered by key press p . A latency test will be done on incoming and outgoing connections to the node. Outgoing connections(peers in topology file), ping type used is done in this order: 1. cncli - If available, this gives the most accurate measure as it checks the entire handshake process against the remote peer. 2. ss - Sends a TCP SYN package to ping the remote peer on the cardano-node port. Should give ~100% success rate. 2. tcptraceroute - Same as ss. 3. ping - fallback method using ICMP ping against IP. Will only work if firewall of remote peer accept ICMP traffic. For incoming connections, only ICMP ping is used as remote peer port is unknown. It's not uncommon to see many undetermined peers for incoming connections as it's a good security practice to disable ICMP in firewall.

Since the network has to get along without the P2P network module for the time being, it needs static topology files. This \"TopologyUpdater\" service, which is far from being perfect due to its centralization factor, is intended to be a temporary solution to allow everyone to activate their relay nodes without having to postpone and wait for manual topology completion requests. You should NOT set up topologyUpdater for your block producing nodes. The topologyUpdater shell script must be executed on the relay node as a cronjob exactly every 60 minutes . After 4 consecutive requests (3 hours) the node is considered a new relay node in listed in the topology file. If the node is turned off, it's automatically delisted after 3 hours. Download and Configure \u2693\ufe0e If you have run prereqs.sh , this should already be available in your scripts folder and make this step unnecessary. Before the updater can make a valid request to the central topology service, it must query the current tip/blockNo from the well-synced local node. It connects to your node through the configuration in the script as well as the common env configuration file. Customize these files for your needs.

Add the script to be executed once per hour at a minute of your choice (eg xx:25 o'clock in the example below). The example below will handle both the fetch and push in a single call to the script once an hour.

Until reaching this point, your fetch calls will only return IOG peers combined with any custom peers added in USER VARIABLES section of topologyUpdater.sh script The engineers of cardano-node network stack suggested to use around 20 peers. More peers create unnecessary and unwanted system load and delays. In its default setting, topologyUpdater returns a list of 15 remote peers. Note that the change in topology is only effective upon restart of your node. Make sure you account for some scheduled restarts on your relays, to help onboard newer relays onto the network (as described in the systemd section ). How do I add my own relays/static nodes in addition to dynamic list generated by topologyUpdater? \u2693\ufe0e Most of the Stake Pool Operators may have few preferences (own relays, close friends, etc) that they would like to add to their topology by default. This is where the CUSTOM_PEERS variable in topologyUpdater.sh comes in. You can add a list of peers in the format of: hostname/IP:port[:valency] here and the output topology.json formed will already include the custom peers that you supplied. Every custom peer is defined in the form [address]:[port] and optional :[valency] (if not specified, the valency defaults to 1 ). Multiple custom peers are separated by | .

We then order the peers by distance (closest first) and start by selecting one peer. We then skip some, pick the next, skip, pick, skip, pick ... until we reach the end of the list (furthest away).

Container breakouts: Caused when the user is able to escape the container namespace and interact with other processes on the host. Denial-of-service attacks: Occur when some containers take up enough resources to hamper the functioning of other applications. Poisoned images: Caused when an untrusted image is being run and a hacker is able to access application data and, potentially, the host itself. Docker containers are now being exploited to covertly mine for cryptocurrency, marking a shift from ransomware to cryptocurrency malware. As with all things in security, also Docker security is a moving target \u2014 so it\u2019s helpful to have access to up-to-date information, including experience-based best practices, for securing your containerized environments. Here below some key concepts: \u2693\ufe0e Use a Third-Party Security Tool Docker allows you to use containers from untrusted public repositories, which increases the need to scrutinize whether the container was created securely and whether it is free of any corrupt or malicious files. For this, use a multi-purpose security tool that gives extensive dev-to-production security controls.(keep reading below) Manage Vulnerability It is best to have a sound vulnerability management program that has multiple checks throughout the container lifecycle. Vulnerability management should incorporate quality gates to detect access issues and weaknesses for a potential exploit from dev-to-production environments. Monitor and Audit Container Activity It is vital to monitor the container ecosystem and detect suspicious activity. Container monitoring activities provide real-time reports that can help you react promptly to a security breach. Enable Docker Content Trust Docker Content Trust is a new feature incorporated into Docker 1.8. It is disabled by default, but once enabled, allows you to verify the integrity, authenticity, and publication date of all Docker images from the Docker Hub Registry. Use Docker Bench for Security You should consider Docker Bench for Security as your must-use script. Once the script is run, you will notice a lot of information regarding configuration best practices for deploying Docker containers that can be used to further secure your Docker server and containers. Resource Utilization To reduce performance impacts and denial-of-service attacks, it is a good practice to implement limits on the system resources that the containers can consume. If, for example, a web server is compromised, it helps to limit the impact to the other processes that are running on a host. RBAC RBAC is role-based access control. If you have multiple users accessing you enviroment, this is a must-have. It can be quite expensive to implement but portainer makes it super easy.
