Please refer to sample guidance [here ](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/network-ntp) for details - the precise steps may depend on your OS.\n- Ensure your Firewall rules at Network as well as OS level are updated according to the usage of your system, you'd want to whitelist the rules that you really need to open to world (eg: You might need node, SSH, and potentially secured webserver/proxy ports to be open, depending on components you run).\n- Update your SSH Configuration to prevent password-based logon.\n- Ensure that you use offline workflow, you should never require to have your offline keys on online nodes.

The old <code>prereqs.sh</code> is left as-is but will no longer be maintained.</li> <li>Improve handling of environment variables for top level folder. Prior to this point, those who were using multiple deployments on same machine were required to have their session's environment set (for instance, using <code>prereqs.sh -t pvnode</code> would have created folder structure as <code>/opt/cardano/pvnode</code> and replaced <code>CNODE_HOME</code> references within scripts with <code>PVNODE_HOME</code>. This will no longer be required. The deriving of top level folder will be done relative to scripts folder. Thus, parent of the folder containing <code>env</code> file will automatically be treated as top level folder, and no longer depend on external environment variable. One may still use them for their own comfort to switch directories.</li> <li>The above also helps for manual download of script from github as it will no longer require substituting <code>CNODE_HOME</code> references.</li> <li>Consolidate binaries deployment to <code>\"${HOME}\"/.local/bin</code>. Previously, we could have had binaries deployed to various locations (<code>\"${HOME}\"/.cabal/bin</code> for node/CLI binaries, <code>\"${HOME}\"/.cargo/bin</code> for cncli binary, <code>\"${HOME}\"/bin</code> for downloaded binaries). This occured because of different compilers used different default locations for their output binariess (cargo for rust, cabal for Haskell, etc). The guild-deploy.sh/cabal-build-all.sh scripts will now provision the binaries to be made available to \"${HOME}\"/.local/bin instead. Ofcourse, as before, you can still customise the location of binaries using variables (eg: <code>CCLI</code>, <code>CNCLI</code>, <code>CNODE_HOME</code>) in <code>env</code> file.</li> <li>Add option to download pre-compiled binaries instead of compiling them - and accordingly - options in <code>guild-deploy.sh</code>, giving users both the options.</li> </ul> <p>Some of the above required us to add breaking changes to some scripts, but hopefully the above explains the premise for those changes. To ease this one-time upgrade process for existing deployments,  we have tried to come up with the guide below, feel free to edit this file to improve the documents based on your experience. Again, apologies in advance to those who do not agree with the above changes (the old code would ofcourse remain unimpacted at tag <code>legacy-scripts</code>, so if you'd like to stick to old scripts , you can use <code>-b legacy-scripts</code> for your tools to switch back).  </p>"},{"location":"upgrade/#steps-for-ugrading","title":"Steps for Ugrading","text":"<p>Warning</p> <p>Make sure you go through upgrade steps for your setup in a non-mainnet environment first!</p> <ul> <li>Download the latest <code>guild-deploy.sh</code> (checkout new syntax with <code>guild-deploy.sh -h</code>) to update all the scripts and files from the guild template. The scripts modified with user content (<code>env</code>, <code>gLiveView.sh</code>, <code>topologyUpdater.sh</code>, <code>cnode.sh</code>, etc) will be backed up before overwriting. The backed up files will be in the same folder as the original files, and will be named as <code>${filename}_bkp&lt;timestamp&gt;</code>. More static files (genesis files or some of the scripts themselves) will not be backed up, as they're not expected to be modified.</li> </ul> <p>Remember</p> <p>Please add any environment-specific parameters (eg: custom top level folder, network flag, etc) to the execution command below, similar to prereqs.sh (check new syntax using <code>guild-deploy.sh -h</code>)</p> <ul> <li>A basic (minimal) run of the guild-deploy script that will only update current scripts on mainnet using default paths:</li> </ul> <pre><code>mkdir \"$HOME/tmp\";cd \"$HOME/tmp\"\ncurl -sS -o guild-deploy.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cardano-community/guild-operators/master/scripts/cnode-helper-scripts/guild-deploy.sh\nchmod 700 guild-deploy.sh\n./guild-deploy.sh -s f -b master\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>Source your bashrc file again , and ensure <code>\"${HOME}\"/.local/bin</code> is now part of your $PATH environment variable.</li> </ul> <pre><code>source \"${HOME}\"/.bashrc\necho \"${PATH}\"\n</code></pre> <ul> <li> <p>Check and add back your customisations to config files (or simply restore from automatically created backup of your config/topology files).</p> </li> <li> <p>Since one of the basic changes we start to recommend as part of this revamp is moving your binaries to <code>\"${HOME}/.local/bin</code>, you would want to move the binaries below from current location:</p> <ul> <li>\"${HOME}\"/.cabal/bin - Binaries built by <code>cabal build all</code> script (eg: <code>cardano-node</code>, <code>cardano-cli</code>, <code>bech32</code>, <code>cardano-address</code>, <code>cardano-submit-api</code>, <code>cardano-db-sync</code></li> <li>\"${HOME}\"/.cargo/bin - Binaries built by <code>cardano install</code> (eg: <code>cncli</code>)</li> <li>\"${HOME}\"/bin - Downloaded binaries from previous <code>prereqs.sh</code> (eg: <code>cardano-hw-cli</code>)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>You can move the binaries by using mv command (for example, if you dont have any other files in these folders, you can use the command below:</p> <p>Note</p> <p>Ideally, you should shutdown services (eg: cnode, cnode-dbsync, etc) prior to running the below to ensure they run from new location (you can also re-deploy them if you haven't done so in a while, eg: <code>./cnode.sh -d</code>). At the end of the guide, you can start them back up.</p> <pre><code>mv -t \"${HOME}\"/.local/bin/ \"${HOME}\"/.cabal/bin/* \"${HOME}\"/.cargo/bin/* \"${HOME}\"/bin/*\n</code></pre> <ul> <li> <p>We've found users often confuse between $PATH variable resolution between multiple shell sessions, systemd, etc. To avoid this, edit the following files and uncomment and set the following variables to the appropriate paths as per your deployment (eg: <code>CCLI=\"${HOME}\"/.local/bin/cardano-cli</code> if following above):</p> <ul> <li>env : CCLI, CNCLI, CNODEBIN</li> <li>[If applicable] dbsync.sh: DBSYNCBIN</li> <li>[If applicable] submitapi.sh: SUBMITAPIBIN</li> <li>[If applicable] ogmios.sh: OGMIOSBIN</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>The above should take care of tools and services. However, you might still have duplicate binaries in your $PATH (previous artifacts, re-build using old scripts, etc) - it is best that you remove any old binary files from alternate folders. You can do so by executing the below:</p> </li> </ul> <pre><code>whereis bech32 cardano-address cardano-cli cardano-db-sync cardano-hw-cli cardano-node cardano-submit-api cncli ogmios\n</code></pre> <p>The above might result in some lines having more than one entry (eg: you might have <code>cardano-cli</code> in <code>\"${HOME}\"/.cabal/bin</code> and <code>\"${HOME}\"/.local/bin</code>) - for which you'd want to delete the reference(s) not in <code>\"${HOME}\"/.local/bin</code> , while for other cases - you might have no values (eg: you may not use <code>cardano-db-sync</code>, <code>cncli</code>, <code>ogmios</code> and/or <code>cardano-hw-cli</code>.

CNTools connects to your node through the configuration in the <code>env</code> file located in the same directory as the script. Customize <code>env</code> and <code>cntools.sh</code> files to your needs.</p> <p>Additionally, CNTools can integrate and enable optional functionalities based on external components:</p> <ul> <li><code>cncli.sh</code> is a companion script with optional functionalities to run on the core node (block producer) such as monitoring created blocks, calculating leader schedules and block validation.</li> <li><code>logMonitor.sh</code> is another companion script meant to be run together with the <code>cncli.sh</code> script to give a more complete picture.</li> </ul> <p>See CNCLI and Log Monitor sections for more details.</p> <p>CNTools can operate in following modes:</p> <ul> <li>Advanced - When CNTools is launched with <code>-a</code> runtime argument, this launches CNTools exposing a new <code>Advanced</code> menu, which allows users to manage (create/mint/burn) new assets.</li> <li>Online - When all wallet and pool keys are available on the hot node, use this option. This is the default mode when you start CNTools without parameters.</li> <li>Hybrid - When running in online mode, this option can be used in menus to create offline transaction files that can be passed to Offline CNTools to sign.</li> <li>Offline - When CNTools is launched with <code>-o</code> runtime argument, this launches CNTools with limited set of features. This mode does not require access to cardano-node.

At a very high level, for working with offline devices, remember that you need to use CNTools in an online node to generate a staging transaction for the desired type of transaction, and then move the staging transaction to an offline node to sign (authorize) using the signing keys on your offline node - and then bring back the signed transaction to the online node for submission to the chain. </p> <p>For the offline workflow, all the wallet and pool keys should be kept on the offline node. The backup function in CNTools has an option to create a backup without private keys (sensitive signing keys) to be transferred to online node. All other files are included in the backup to be transferred to the online node. </p> <p>Keys excluded from backup when created without private keys: Wallet - <code>payment.skey</code>, <code>stake.skey</code> Pool   - <code>cold.skey</code></p> <p>Note that setting up an offline server requires good SysOps background (you need to be aware of how to set up your server with offline mirror repository, how to transfer files across and be fairly familiar with the disk layout of guild tools). The <code>guild-deploy.sh</code> in its current state is not expected to run on an offline machine. Essentially, you simply need the <code>cardano-cli</code>, <code>bech32</code>, <code>cardano-address</code> binaries in your <code>$PATH</code>, OS level dependency packages [<code>jq</code>, <code>coreutils</code>, <code>pkgconfig</code>, <code>gcc-c++</code> and <code>bc</code> ], and perhaps a copy from your online <code>cnode</code> directory (to ensure you have the right <code>genesis</code>/<code>config</code> files on your offline server).

A slot on MainNet happens every 1 second(<code>slotLength</code>), thus the max chain density can be calculated as <code>slotLength/activeSlotsCoeff = 5%</code>. Normally, the value should fluctuate around this value.  </li> <li>Total Tx - The total number of transactions processed since node start.  </li> <li>Pending Tx - The number of transactions and the bytes(total, in kb) currently in mempool to be included in upcoming blocks.  </li> <li>Tip (ref) - Reference tip is an offline calculation based on genesis values for current slot height since genesis start.  </li> <li>Tip (diff) / Status - Will either show node status as <code>starting|sync xx.x%</code> or if close to reference tip, the tip difference <code>Tip (ref) - Tip (node)</code> to see how far of the tip (diff value) the node is. With current parameters a slot diff up to 40 from reference tip is considered good but it should usually stay below 30. It's perfectly normal to see big differences in slots between blocks. It's the built in randomness at play. To see if a node is really healthy and staying on tip you would need to compare the tip between multiple nodes.  </li> <li>Forks - The number of forks since node start. Each fork means the blockchain evolved in a different direction, thereby discarding blocks. A high number of forks means there is a higher chance of orphaned blocks.  </li> <li>Peers In / Out - Shows how many connections the node has established in and out. See Peer analysis section for how to get more details of incoming and outgoing connections.  </li> <li>P2P Mode </li> <li><code>Cold</code> peers indicate the number of inactive but known peers to the node.</li> <li><code>Warm</code> peers tell how many established connections the node has.</li> <li><code>Hot</code> peers how many established connections are actually active.</li> <li><code>Bi-Dir</code>(bidirectional) and <code>Uni-Dir</code>(unidirectional) indicate how the handshake protocol negotiated the connection. The connection between p2p nodes will always be bidirectional, but it will be unidirectional between p2p nodes and non-p2p nodes. </li> <li><code>Duplex</code> shows the connections that are actually used in both directions, only bidirectional connections have this potential.</li> <li>Mem (RSS) - RSS is the Resident Set Size and shows how much memory is allocated to cardano-node and that is in RAM. It does not include memory that is swapped out. It does include memory from shared libraries as long as the pages from those libraries are actually in memory. It does include all stack and heap memory.  </li> <li>Mem (Live) / (Heap) - GC (Garbage Collector) values that show how much memory is used for live/heap data. A large difference between them (or the heap approaching the physical memory limit) means the node is struggling with the garbage collector and/or may begin swapping.  </li> <li>GC Minor / Major - Collecting garbage from \"Young space\" is called a Minor GC. Major (Full) GC is done more rarily and is a more expensive operation. Explaining garbage collection is a topic outside the scope of this documentation and google is your friend for this.  </li> <li>Block propagation - Last delay measures the duration between when the last block was scheduled to be produced and when the node learned about it. Late blocks are blocks whose delay is larger than 5s. If the node is not synching, the number of late blocks needs to stay low. Within \u2153/5s estimates the chance of observing a delay of \u2153/5s (based on the delays observed for previous blocks). A healthy node needs to stay above 95% of blocks within 3s. Finally, served blocks counts how many blocks were fetched by \"in\" peers. If this does not increase for a long time, it means the \"in\" peers are learning about new blocks from somewhere else (and therefore this node is not contributing towards accelerating the propagation).
